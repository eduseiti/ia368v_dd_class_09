The virus infection spread rapidly and swept through China in less than a month. Subsequently, the virus was proven a novel coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of novel coronavirus has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 31, 2020. Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous. Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow. Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas.

       "      <td>Background: We have previously shown that human mRNAs are present in saliva and can be used as biomarkers of oral cancer. In this study, we analyzed the integrity, sources, and stability of salivary RNA. Methods: We measured the integrity of salivary RNA with reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) or RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). To study RNA entry sites into the oral cavity, we used RT-PCR analysis of salivary RNA from the 3 major salivary glands, gingival crevice fluid, and desquamated oral epithelial cells. We measured stability of the salivary β-actin mRNA by RT-qPCR of salivary RNA incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. We measured RNA association with other macromolecules by filtering saliva through pores of different sizes before performing RT-qPCR. To assess RNA–macromolecule interaction, we incubated saliva with Triton X-100 for different periods of time before performing RT-qPCR. Results: In most cases, we detected partial- to full-length salivary mRNAs and smaller amounts of middle and 3′ gene amplicons compared with the 5′. RNA was present in all oral fluids examined. Endogenous salivary β-actin mRNA degraded more slowly than exogenous β-actin mRNA, with half-lives of 12.2 and 0.4 min, respectively (P &lt;0.001). Salivary RNA could not pass through 0.22 or 0.45 μm pores. Incubation of saliva with Triton X-100 accelerated degradation of salivary RNA. Conclusions: Saliva harbors both full-length and partially degraded forms of mRNA. RNA enters the oral cavity from different sources, and association with macromolecules may protect salivary RNA from degradation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV, characterized by an over-exuberant immune response with lung lymphomononuclear cells infiltration and proliferation that may account for tissue damage more than the direct effect of viral replication. This study is aimed at investigating the capability of SARS-CoV to activate IFN-α and -γ expression in lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from healthy donors, evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation. Results: SARS-CoV virus is able to induce both IFN-α and -γ mRNA accumulation and protein release in a dose-dependent manner, MOI 10 being the most effective. The time course curve indicated that IFN-α mRNA induction peaked at 24 h.p.i,. whereas IFN-γ mRNA was still increasing at 48 h.p.i. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24–48 h.p.i. and remained rather stable over a 5-day period. A transient peak of negative strand viral RNA was detected after 1–2 days of infection, but neither infectious virus progeny yield nor newly produced viral genomic RNA could be evidenced in infected cultures, even after prolonged observation time (up to 13 days). Cocultivation of PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells was even more efficient than exposure to live virus in eliciting IFN-α and -γ induction. A combination of IFN-α and -γ strongly inhibited SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells, while the single cytokines were much less effective. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV is able to induce in normal PBMC a coordinate induction of IFN-α and -γ gene expression. Virus replication is not necessary for IFN induction since efficient IFN expression could be obtained also by the cocultivation of normal PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected cells. Concomitant activation of IFN-α and -γ gene expression by SARS-CoV in vivo may be relevant for the pathogenesis of the disease, both for the possible involvement in immunomediated damage of the tissues and for the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV replication as a result of combined cytokine action.</td>\n",

Neither curative anti-viral drugs nor a protective vaccine is currently available for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Recently, new clinical syndromes associated with coagulopathy and vasculopathy have emerged as a cause of sudden death and other serious clinical manifestations in younger patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, is a transmembrane protein expressed by lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes, and vascular endothelial cells, whose physiologic role is to induce the maturation of angiotensin I to generate angiotensin 1-7, a peptide hormone that controls vasoconstriction and blood pressure. In this review, we provide the general context of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on endothelial cells, describe the vasculopathy and coagulopathy syndromes in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and outline current understanding of the underlying mechanistic aspects.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The field of directed RNA interference (RNAi) has rapidly developed into a highly promising approach for specifically downregulating genes to alleviate disease pathology. This technology is especially well-suited to treating viral infections, and numerous examples now illustrate that a wide range of viruses can be inhibited with RNAi, both in vitro and in vivo. One principle that has arisen from this work is that antiviral RNAi therapies must be tailored to the unique life cycle of each pathogen, including the choice of delivery vehicle, route of administration, gene(s) targeted and regulation and duration of RNAi induction. Although effective strategies will be customized to each virus, all such therapies must overcome similar challenges. Importantly, treatment strategies must compensate for the inevitable fact that viral genome sequences evolve extremely rapidly, and computational and bioinformatics approaches may aid in the development of therapies that resist viral escape. Furthermore, all RNAi strategies involve the delivery of nucleic acids to target cells, and all will therefore benefit from the development of enhanced gene design and delivery technologies. Here, we review the substantial progress that has been made towards identifying effective antiviral RNAi targets and discuss strategies for translating these findings into effective clinical therapies.</td>\n",

The virus infection spread rapidly and swept through China in less than a month. Subsequently, the virus was proven a novel coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of novel coronavirus has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 31, 2020. Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous. Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow. Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas. In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on.   \n",

In this study, we analyzed the integrity, sources, and stability of salivary RNA. Methods: We measured the integrity of salivary RNA with reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) or RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). To study RNA entry sites into the oral cavity, we used RT-PCR analysis of salivary RNA from the 3 major salivary glands, gingival crevice fluid, and desquamated oral epithelial cells. We measured stability of the salivary β-actin mRNA by RT-qPCR of salivary RNA incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. We measured RNA association with other macromolecules by filtering saliva through pores of different sizes before performing RT-qPCR. To assess RNA–macromolecule interaction, we incubated saliva with Triton X-100 for different periods of time before performing RT-qPCR. Results: In most cases, we detected partial- to full-length salivary mRNAs and smaller amounts of middle and 3′ gene amplicons compared with the 5′. RNA was present in all oral fluids examined. Endogenous salivary β-actin mRNA degraded more slowly than exogenous β-actin mRNA, with half-lives of 12.2 and 0.4 min, respectively (P <0.001). Salivary RNA could not pass through 0.22 or 0.45 μm pores. Incubation of saliva with Triton X-100 accelerated degradation of salivary RNA. Conclusions: Saliva harbors both full-length and partially degraded forms of mRNA. RNA enters the oral cavity from different sources, and association with macromolecules may protect salivary RNA from degradation.   \n",
       "66332  Abstract Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV, characterized by an over-exuberant immune response with lung lymphomononuclear cells infiltration and proliferation that may account for tissue damage more than the direct effect of viral replication. This study is aimed at investigating the capability of SARS-CoV to activate IFN-α and -γ expression in lymphomonocytes (PBMC) from healthy donors, evaluating whether viral replication is necessary for this activation. Results: SARS-CoV virus is able to induce both IFN-α and -γ mRNA accumulation and protein release in a dose-dependent manner, MOI 10 being the most effective. The time course curve indicated that IFN-α mRNA induction peaked at 24 h.p.i,. whereas IFN-γ mRNA was still increasing at 48 h.p.i. Released IFN (both types) reached a plateau after 24–48 h.p.i. and remained rather stable over a 5-day period. A transient peak of negative strand viral RNA was detected after 1–2 days of infection, but neither infectious virus progeny yield nor newly produced viral genomic RNA could be evidenced in infected cultures, even after prolonged observation time (up to 13 days). Cocultivation of PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells was even more efficient than exposure to live virus in eliciting IFN-α and -γ induction. A combination of IFN-α and -γ strongly inhibited SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells, while the single cytokines were much less effective. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV is able to induce in normal PBMC a coordinate induction of IFN-α and -γ gene expression. Virus replication is not necessary for IFN induction since efficient IFN expression could be obtained also by the cocultivation of normal PBMC with fixed SARS-CoV-infected cells. Concomitant activation of IFN-α and -γ gene expression by SARS-CoV in vivo may be relevant for the pathogenesis of the disease, both for the possible involvement in immunomediated damage of the tissues and for the strong inhibition of SARS-CoV replication as a result of combined cytokine action.   \n",

Neither curative anti-viral drugs nor a protective vaccine is currently available for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Recently, new clinical syndromes associated with coagulopathy and vasculopathy have emerged as a cause of sudden death and other serious clinical manifestations in younger patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, is a transmembrane protein expressed by lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes, and vascular endothelial cells, whose physiologic role is to induce the maturation of angiotensin I to generate angiotensin 1-7, a peptide hormone that controls vasoconstriction and blood pressure. In this review, we provide the general context of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on endothelial cells, describe the vasculopathy and coagulopathy syndromes in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and outline current understanding of the underlying mechanistic aspects.   \n",

This technology is especially well-suited to treating viral infections, and numerous examples now illustrate that a wide range of viruses can be inhibited with RNAi, both in vitro and in vivo. One principle that has arisen from this work is that antiviral RNAi therapies must be tailored to the unique life cycle of each pathogen, including the choice of delivery vehicle, route of administration, gene(s) targeted and regulation and duration of RNAi induction. Although effective strategies will be customized to each virus, all such therapies must overcome similar challenges. Importantly, treatment strategies must compensate for the inevitable fact that viral genome sequences evolve extremely rapidly, and computational and bioinformatics approaches may aid in the development of therapies that resist viral escape. Furthermore, all RNAi strategies involve the delivery of nucleic acids to target cells, and all will therefore benefit from the development of enhanced gene design and delivery technologies. Here, we review the substantial progress that has been made towards identifying effective antiviral RNAi targets and discuss strategies for translating these findings into effective clinical therapies.   \n",

METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.</td>\n",

Although NO• is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO• to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO• generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively.

       "      <td>Surfactant protein-D and pulmonary host defenseSurfactant protein-D (SP-D) participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens, and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung. SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.</td>\n",

The respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression, including production of chemoattractant cytokines, adhesion molecules, elements that are related to the apoptosis response, and others that remain incompletely understood. Here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches, including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene array strategies, that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Heterogeneity and plasticity of porcine alveolar macrophage and pulmonary interstitial macrophage isolated from healthy pigs in vitroThis study investigated the heterogeneity and plasticity of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and pulmonary interstitial macrophages (IM) isolated from healthy pigs, including phenotype, function and gene expression. Dynamic changes of nitric oxide (NO) levels secreted by PAM and IM with stimulation of different doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated by Griess method, and the viability of the PAM and IM cells was investigated by MTT assay. Flow cytometry, fluorescence quantitative PCR and ELISA techniques were used to measure cell phenotype, gene expression and cytokine secretion, respectively. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs showed heterogeneity with 95.42±1.51% and 31.99±5.84% of CD163+ macrophage, respectively. The NO level in IM was significantly higher versus PAM after LPS treatment. Consistently, the ratio of Arg I/iNOS in IM was much lower than that in PAM, suggesting that the PAM belong to M2 macrophages and the IM belong to M1 macrophages. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs also showed plasticity. The Arg I/iNOS ratio and TIMP1/MMP12 ratio were significantly decreased in LPS- or LPS+IFNγ-treated PAM and IM, suggesting that cells were polarized towards M1 macrophages under LPS or LPS+IFNγ stimulation. On the contrary, IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation on PAM and IM lead to M2 polarization. A similar result was found in IL-1β gene expression and TNFα secretion. In conclusion, porcine macrophages have shown heterogeneity and plasticity on polarization under the stimulation of LPS, IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-13.</td>\n",

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.  \n",

The respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression, including production of chemoattractant cytokines, adhesion molecules, elements that are related to the apoptosis response, and others that remain incompletely understood. Here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches, including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene array strategies, that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.  \n",

Dynamic changes of nitric oxide (NO) levels secreted by PAM and IM with stimulation of different doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated by Griess method, and the viability of the PAM and IM cells was investigated by MTT assay. Flow cytometry, fluorescence quantitative PCR and ELISA techniques were used to measure cell phenotype, gene expression and cytokine secretion, respectively. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs showed heterogeneity with 95.42±1.51% and 31.99±5.84% of CD163+ macrophage, respectively. The NO level in IM was significantly higher versus PAM after LPS treatment. Consistently, the ratio of Arg I/iNOS in IM was much lower than that in PAM, suggesting that the PAM belong to M2 macrophages and the IM belong to M1 macrophages. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs also showed plasticity. The Arg I/iNOS ratio and TIMP1/MMP12 ratio were significantly decreased in LPS- or LPS+IFNγ-treated PAM and IM, suggesting that cells were polarized towards M1 macrophages under LPS or LPS+IFNγ stimulation. On the contrary, IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation on PAM and IM lead to M2 polarization. A similar result was found in IL-1β gene expression and TNFα secretion. In conclusion, porcine macrophages have shown heterogeneity and plasticity on polarization under the stimulation of LPS, IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-13.  \n",

From such experiments, important constraints on the protein or peptide conformation can be derived. Specifically, our aim is to localize an iodine-labelled phenylalanine in the SARS E protein, incorporated in DMPC phospholipid bilayers, which are deposited in the form of thick multilamellar stacks on silicon surfaces. Here, we discuss the experimental aspects and the difficulties associated with the Fourier synthesis analysis that gives the electron density profile of the membranes.  \n",

METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Surfactant protein-D and pulmonary host defenseSurfactant protein-D (SP-D) participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens, and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung. SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.</td>\n",

The respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression, including production of chemoattractant cytokines, adhesion molecules, elements that are related to the apoptosis response, and others that remain incompletely understood. Here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches, including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene array strategies, that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.</td>\n",

Dynamic changes of nitric oxide (NO) levels secreted by PAM and IM with stimulation of different doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated by Griess method, and the viability of the PAM and IM cells was investigated by MTT assay. Flow cytometry, fluorescence quantitative PCR and ELISA techniques were used to measure cell phenotype, gene expression and cytokine secretion, respectively. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs showed heterogeneity with 95.42±1.51% and 31.99±5.84% of CD163+ macrophage, respectively. The NO level in IM was significantly higher versus PAM after LPS treatment. Consistently, the ratio of Arg I/iNOS in IM was much lower than that in PAM, suggesting that the PAM belong to M2 macrophages and the IM belong to M1 macrophages. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs also showed plasticity. The Arg I/iNOS ratio and TIMP1/MMP12 ratio were significantly decreased in LPS- or LPS+IFNγ-treated PAM and IM, suggesting that cells were polarized towards M1 macrophages under LPS or LPS+IFNγ stimulation. On the contrary, IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation on PAM and IM lead to M2 polarization. A similar result was found in IL-1β gene expression and TNFα secretion. In conclusion, porcine macrophages have shown heterogeneity and plasticity on polarization under the stimulation of LPS, IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-13.</td>\n",

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.  \n",

The respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression, including production of chemoattractant cytokines, adhesion molecules, elements that are related to the apoptosis response, and others that remain incompletely understood. Here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches, including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene array strategies, that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.  \n",

Dynamic changes of nitric oxide (NO) levels secreted by PAM and IM with stimulation of different doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were investigated by Griess method, and the viability of the PAM and IM cells was investigated by MTT assay. Flow cytometry, fluorescence quantitative PCR and ELISA techniques were used to measure cell phenotype, gene expression and cytokine secretion, respectively. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs showed heterogeneity with 95.42±1.51% and 31.99±5.84% of CD163+ macrophage, respectively. The NO level in IM was significantly higher versus PAM after LPS treatment. Consistently, the ratio of Arg I/iNOS in IM was much lower than that in PAM, suggesting that the PAM belong to M2 macrophages and the IM belong to M1 macrophages. The PAM and IM cells in normal healthy pigs also showed plasticity. The Arg I/iNOS ratio and TIMP1/MMP12 ratio were significantly decreased in LPS- or LPS+IFNγ-treated PAM and IM, suggesting that cells were polarized towards M1 macrophages under LPS or LPS+IFNγ stimulation. On the contrary, IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation on PAM and IM lead to M2 polarization. A similar result was found in IL-1β gene expression and TNFα secretion. In conclusion, porcine macrophages have shown heterogeneity and plasticity on polarization under the stimulation of LPS, IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-13.  \n",

From such experiments, important constraints on the protein or peptide conformation can be derived. Specifically, our aim is to localize an iodine-labelled phenylalanine in the SARS E protein, incorporated in DMPC phospholipid bilayers, which are deposited in the form of thick multilamellar stacks on silicon surfaces. Here, we discuss the experimental aspects and the difficulties associated with the Fourier synthesis analysis that gives the electron density profile of the membranes.  \n",

      "\"Dexmedetomidine for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients after oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction:a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common and significant problems for oral and maxillofacial surgery patients. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), an α2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been proven having lung protection effects. However, since now, there has not been final conclusion about whether DEX can reduce the incidence of PPCs. We hypothesize that, in oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction patients, DEX may decrease the incidence of PPCs. METHODS This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centered trial with two parallel arms. A total of 160 patients at intermediate-to-high risk of PPCs undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction and tracheotomy were enrolled and randomized to receive continuous infusion of either DEX or placebo (normal saline). 0.4 μg/kg of DEX was given over 10mins as an initial dose followed by a maintaining dose of 0.4 μg/kg/h till the second day morning after surgery. At the same time, the normal saline was administered a similar quantity. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs according to Clavien-Dindo score within 7 days after surgery. RESULTS The two groups had similar characteristics at baseline. 18(22.5%) of 80 patients administered DEX, and 32(40.0%) of 80 patient administered placebo experienced PPCs within the first 7 days after surgery (relative risk [RR] 0.563,95% confidence interval [CI] 0.346-0.916; P = 0.017). In the first 7 days after surgery, the DEX group had a lower incidence of PPCs and a better postoperative survival probability (Log-rank test, P = 0.019), and was less prone to occur PPCs (Cox regression, P = 0.025, HR = 0.516). When the total dose of DEX was more than 328 μg, the patients were unlikely to have PPCs (ROC curve, AUC = 0.614, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS For patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction and tracheotomy who were at intermediate or high risk of developing PPCs, continuous infusion of DEX could decrease the occurrence of PPCs during the first 7 days after surgery and shorten the length of hospital stay after surgery, but did not increase the prevalence of bradycardia or hypotension.

      "\"The Developing Role of Evidence-Based Environmental Health: Perceptions, Experiences, and Understandings From the Front LineThere has been renewed recognition that proactive strategies and interventions can address the social determinants of health, and the environmental health profession is well placed to effect positive change in many of these determinants. This qualitative research has revealed differences in the perceptions, experiences, and understandings of evidence-based practice among public health professionals from different backgrounds across different services in health care and local government in England. The absence of a strong tradition of evidence-based practice in environmental health appears to be a disadvantage in securing funding and playing a full role, as it has become the expectation in the new public health system. This has, at times, resulted in tensions between professionals with different backgrounds and frustration on the part of environmental health practitioners, who have a tradition of responding quickly to new challenges and “getting on with the job.” There is generally a willingness to develop evidence-based practice in environmental health; however, this will take time and investment.\"\n",

      "\"Management strategies of autoimmune bullous diseases during the outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)Since late December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, which is mainly characterized by pulmonary lesions, has spread quickly worldwide. With the spread of the novel coronavirus, the outpatient lines of hospitals have mostly shut down, which means that routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for autoimmune bullous diseases patients have been disturbed. Due to the serious condition of autoimmune bullous diseases patients, they are prone to immune suppression and circulatory failure, and are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. These patients should thus be a priority group for novel coronavirus disease prevention. In this context, the protection and control measures for autoimmune bullous diseases patients against the novel coronavirus are of serious concern. Clinicians should strengthen their communication with patients, pay attention to changes in patients' conditions, and carefully adjust the treatment strategy, while protecting against the novel coronavirus infection, to ensure the continuity, safety, and effectiveness of autoimmune bullous diseases treatment.\"\n",

      "\"Inflammation in laparoendoscopic single-site surgery versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy.INTRODUCTION Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) uses a multiple-entry portal in a single 3.0- to 4.0-cm incision in a natural scar, the umbilicus. The present study aimed to compare the inflammatory impact of classic video laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) versus LESS cholecystectomy. METHODS A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted from January to June 2011 at 2 university hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Fifty-seven patients (53 women, 4 men; mean age = 48.7 years) were randomly assigned to receive LC (n = 29) or LESS (n = 28) cholecystectomy. C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured from blood samples collected during induction of anesthesia and at 3 and 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS Median IL-6 levels in the LESS and LC groups, respectively, were 2.96 and 4.5 pg/mL preoperatively, 11.6 and 28.05 pg/mL at 3 hours postoperatively (P = .029), and 13.18 and 15.1 pg/mL at 24 hours postoperatively (P = .52). Median CRP levels in the LESS and LC groups, respectively, were 0.33 and 0.44 mg/mL preoperatively, 0.40 and 0.45 mg/mL (P = .73) at 3 hours postoperatively, and 1.7 and 1.82 mg/mL (P = .84) at 24 hours postoperatively. We did not find a significant association between IL-6 (and CRP) and body mass index in the LESS group. CONCLUSIONS LESS cholecystectomy requires a larger size incision than LC. We found a tendency of less postoperative pain following LESS cholecystectomy than LC. There was also a tendency toward lower early inflammatory impact following LESS cholecystectomy versus LC.\"\n",

      "\"A scoping review on the prevalence of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli in wild animal species.Zoonotic pathogens constitute the major source (60.3%) of emerging infectious diseases. Previous studies have investigated the prevalence of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) among wild animal species, but comprehensive data are needed to assess the role that these animals have in the transmission of STEC infections to the human population via faecal contamination of the environment, agri-food or water chain. Due to the nature of these microorganisms in which this human-animal-environment interface plays a relevant role on the disease's dynamics, a \"One Health\" approach is needed to prevent and control the worldwide spread. The aim of this study was to review the published research on the prevalence of STEC in wildlife. The search was performed using several online databases consisting of three blocks of specific search terms covering pathogen, type of study and population. Two reviewers applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to screening and eligibility phases. Two hundred and twenty-five abstracts were screened for relevance, and 72 were included for data analysis. Most studies (77.8%) investigated the prevalence of STEC in ruminants and urban birds. Their role in transmitting the pathogen to humans, other animals and the agri-food chain is potentiated by the peculiar biological characteristics in ruminants and improved adaptation of urban birds to urban environments. The popularity of convenience and voluntary response sampling may be due to the lack of human-made boundaries on the wild animal species' habitat and having some samples from hunted-harvested animals. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on STEC prevalence in wild animal species from studies conducted across the globe. We recommend that future research includes and compares samples from varying origins (i.e., human, animal, environment and food) and applies a \"One Health\" approach to the emerging challenges that STEC poses to public health.\"\n",

      "\"What is known about paediatric nurse burnout: a scoping reviewBurnout in healthcare providers has impacts at the level of the individual provider, patient, and organization. While there is a substantial body of literature on burnout in healthcare providers, burnout in pediatric nurses has received less attention. This subpopulation may be unique from adult care nurses because of the specialized nature of providing care to children who are typically seen as a vulnerable population, the high potential for empathetic engagement, and the inherent complexities in the relationships with families. Thus, the aim of this scoping review was to investigate, among pediatric nurses, (i) the prevalence and/or degree of burnout, (ii) the factors related to burnout, (iii) the outcomes of burnout, and (iv) the interventions that have been applied to prevent and/or mitigate burnout. This scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA Guidelines Scoping Review Extension. CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, and The Cochrane Library were searched on 3 November 2018 to identify relevant quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies on pediatric nurse burnout. Our search identified 78 studies for inclusion in the analysis. Across the included studies, burnout was prevalent in pediatric nurses. A number of factors were identified as impacting burnout including nurse demographics, work environment, and work attitudes. Similarly, a number of outcomes of burnout were identified including nurse retention, nurse well-being, patient safety, and patient-family satisfaction. Unfortunately, there was little evidence of effective interventions to address pediatric nurse burnout. Given the prevalence and impact of burnout on a variety of important outcomes, it is imperative that nursing schools, nursing management, healthcare organizations, and nursing professional associations work to develop and test the interventions to address key attitudinal and environmental factors that are most relevant to pediatric nurses.\"\n",

      "\"Litsea Species as Potential Antiviral Plant Sources.Litsea verticillata Hance (Lauraceae), a Chinese medicine used to treat swelling caused by injury or by snake bites, was the first plant identified by our National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (ICBG) project to exhibit anti-HIV activities. From this plant, we discovered a class of 8 novel litseane compounds, prototypic sesquiterpenes, all of which demonstrated anti-HIV activities. In subsequent studies, 26 additional compounds of different structural types were identified. During our continuing investigation of this plant species, we identified two new litseanes, litseaverticillols L and M, and a new sesquiterpene butenolide, litseasesquibutenolide. Litseaverticillols L and M were found to inhibit HIV-1 replication, with an IC[Formula: see text] value of 49.6[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]M. To further determine the antiviral properties of this plant, several relatively abundant isolates, including a litseane compound, two eudesmane sesquiterpenes and three lignans, were evaluated against an additional 21 viral targets. Lignans 8 and 9 were shown to be active against the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), with EC[Formula: see text] values of 22.0[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]M ([Formula: see text]) and 16.2[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]M ([Formula: see text]), respectively. Since many antiviral compounds have been discovered in L. verticillata, we further prepared 38 plant extracts made from the different plant parts of 9 additional Litsea species. These extracts were evaluated for their anti-HIV and cytotoxic activities, and four of the extracts, which ranged across three different species, displayed 97-100% inhibitory effects against HIV replication without showing cytotoxicity to a panel of human cell lines at a concentration of 20 μg/mL.\"\n",

And it is a dilemma for governments concerned with the security of their citizens, as well as their health. In this article we construct a taxonomy of types of “experiments of concern” in the biological sciences, and thereby map the terrain of ethical risk.

A total of 134 herds were tested twice, six months apart. The herds were classified as positive for BRSV if at least one animal between 150 and 365 days old tested positive for antibodies against BRSV, thereby representing herds that had most likely had the virus present during the previous year. The prevalence of positive herds at the first and second sampling was 34 per cent and at 41 per cent, respectively, but varied greatly between regions. Negative herds were found in close proximity to positive herds. Some of these herds remained negative despite several new infections nearby. Of the herds initially being negative, 42 per cent changed status to positive during the six months. This occurred at the same rate during summer as winter, but a higher rate of animals in the herds was positive if it took place during winter. Of the herds initially being positive, 33 per cent changed to negative. This indicates that an effective strategy to lower the prevalence and the impact of BRSV could be to employ close surveillance and place a high biosecurity focus on the negative herds.\"\n",

      "\"A randomised trial comparing 0.02% mitomycin C and limbal conjunctival autograft after excision of primary pterygium.BACKGROUND Mitomycin C (MMC) and limbal conjunctival autograft (LCAU) are two known useful adjuvants in the prevention of pterygial recurrence. This study was conducted to compare the outcome of these two treatments. METHODS Prospective study on consecutive cases of primary pterygium (February 2001 to March 2002) randomised into two adjuvant groups: (1) intraoperative 0.02% MMC for 5 minutes or (2) LCAU. Patients were followed for recurrence (defined as fibrovascular tissue invading the cornea >1.5mm) and complications for a period of one year. RESULTS 115 eyes in 114 patients who completed the study were randomised to receive MMC (n = 63) and LCAU (n = 52). There were 10 recurrences (15.9%) in the MMC group and only one recurrence (1.9%) in the LCAU group. There was a statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between the two groups (p = 0.04). There were a total of three conjunctival cysts, three symblephara, one granuloma, and one dellen. No other visually significant complications were encountered in either group. CONCLUSION Although LCAU resulted in better one year success rates, it is technically more difficult and inapplicable in cases with previous limbal disturbance. Simple excision followed by MMC or LCAU are both safe and acceptable adjuvants for pterygium excision. Choice of adjuvant should be carefully made based on assessment of recurrence risk, local practices, and surgeon's expertise.\"\n",

      "\"TeleStroke units serving as a model of care in rural areas: 10-year experience of the TeleMedical project for integrative stroke care.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stroke Unit care improves stroke prognosis and is recommended for all patients with stroke. In rural areas, population-wide implementation of Stroke Units is challenging. Therefore, the TeleMedical Project for integrative Stroke Care (TEMPiS) was established in 2003 as a TeleStroke Unit network to overcome this barrier in Southeast Bavaria/Germany. Evaluation of its implementation between 2003 and 2005 had revealed improved process quality and clinical outcomes compared with matched hospitals without TeleStroke Units. Data on sustainability of these effects are lacking. METHODS Effects on the stroke care of the local population were analyzed by using data from official hospital reports. Prospective registries from 2003 to 2012 describe processes and outcomes of consecutive patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack treated in TEMPiS hospitals. Quality indicators assess diagnostics, treatment, and outcome. Rates and timeliness of intravenous thrombolysis as well as data on teleconsultations and secondary interhospital transfers were reported over time. RESULTS Within the covered area, network implementation increased the number of patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack treated in hospitals with (Tele-)Stroke Units substantially from 19% to 78%. Between February 2003 and December 2012, 54 804 strokes and transient ischemic attacks were treated in 15 regional hospitals, and 31 864 teleconsultations were performed. Intravenous thrombolysis was applied 3331 stroke cases with proportions increasing from 2.6% to 15.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke. Median onset-to-treatment times decreased from 150 (interquartile range, 127-163) to 120 minutes (interquartile range, 90-160) and door-to-needle times from 80 (interquartile range, 68-101) to 40 minutes (interquartile range, 29-59). CONCLUSIONS TeleStroke Units can provide sustained high-quality stroke care in rural areas.\"\n",

      "\"Duloxetine added to oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of knee pain due to osteoarthritis: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of duloxetine when added to oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee with pain of moderate or greater severity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a 10-week randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose (duloxetine 60/120 mg/day), placebo-controlled trial that enrolled adult outpatients who had persistent moderate pain (≥4 on a 0-10 numerical rating scale) due to OA of the knee, despite, per protocol, having received optimized oral NSAID therapy (specific drug, dose, and frequency at investigator discretion). CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01018680. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Patients entered daily pain ratings in a telephone-based diary. The primary efficacy outcome was the weekly mean of the daily average pain rating at week 8. Safety outcomes were assessed during the entire 10-week study. RESULTS A total of 524 patients randomly received duloxetine 60/120 mg/day (N = 264) or placebo (N = 260). In total, 74% of the patients completed the study. Mean age was 61 years (SD 9.2), 57% were female, and 81% were white. Duloxetine-treated patients had significantly greater pain reduction at week 8 (p < 0.001) than placebo-treated patients. In addition, relative to placebo at week 8, duloxetine-treated patients had significant improvements in physical function as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (p < 0.001), and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (p < 0.001). Compared to placebo, significantly more nausea, dry mouth, constipation, fatigue and decreased appetite were reported by patients taking duloxetine (each p < 0.05). Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred more commonly in the duloxetine group than the placebo group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Duloxetine added to oral NSAID therapy provided additional significant pain reduction, improved function, and patient-rated impression of improvement. Adverse events were consistent with those seen in previous duloxetine trials. The short duration of the study may not reflect the longer term efficacy and safety of NSAID/duloxetine cotherapy.\"\n",

METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-centre research, including seven centers. Data collection was from 1st Feb to 31st Mar 2020 and the same period last year. RESULTS: There were a total of 28 COVID-19 definite cases in these hospitals. Six out of seven GIE centers were arranged to shut down on 1st Feb, with a mean shutdown days of 23.6±5.3. The actual workloads were only 10.3%-62.9% compared to those last year. All centers had a preoperative COVID-19 screening process. Epidemiological questionnaire, temperature taking and QR-code of journey were conducted. Chest CT scan were conducted during the shutdown period and continued in five centers after return to work. Antibody and nucleic acid test were applied in 1-3 centers. All endoscopists had advanced PPE. Five centers used surgical mask and the rest used N95 mask. Six centers used goggles or face shield. Five centers selected isolation gowns and the rest selected protective suits. The change frequency of these PPE was 4 hours. Sterilizing measures were improved in six centers. Five centers utilized ultraviolet and six centers strengthened natural ventilation. Four and six centers used peracetic acid during the period of shutdown and return to work, alone or matched with OPA or acidified water. CONCLUSIONS: Many effective control measures were conducted in GIE centers during the outbreak, including patients' volume limitation, preoperative COVID-19 screening, advanced PPE and disinfection methods.\"\n",

The effects of SARS and human deaths from Avian Flu are compared directly according to the number of human deaths. The nature of the short run and long run relationship is examined empirically by estimating a static line fixed effect model and a difference transformation dynamic model, respectively. Empirical results from the static fixed effect and difference transformation dynamic models are consistent, and indicate that both the short run and long run SARS effect have a more significant impact on international tourist arrivals than does Avian Flu. In addition, the effects of deaths arising from both SARS and Avian Flu suggest that SARS is more important to international tourist arrivals than is Avian Flu. Thus, while Avian Flu is here to stay, its effect is currently not as significant as that of SARS.\"\n",

This study determined the mortality and hospitalization rates of respiratory diseases in Hong Kong in 2005, their trend in the past decade and their incidence/prevalence. METHODS Mortality data were obtained from the Department of Health and hospitalization data from the Hospital Authority, Hong Kong. Incidence/prevalence data were obtained from local registries or local studies. Trends of mortality and hospitalization rates of various respiratory diseases from 1997 and 2005 were calculated after age standardization and were tested for significance using negative binomial regression analysis. Age standardized mortality rates in Hong Kong were compared with those of the UK and globally. RESULTS Respiratory disease was the most common cause of mortality and hospitalization in Hong Kong in 2005. Globally and in the UK, cardiovascular disease ranked first in mortality. Respiratory infections ranked first in respiratory mortality, followed by respiratory tract cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease. Respiratory infections also ranked first followed by chronic obstructive lung disease in the utilization of respiratory inpatient bed-days. While mortality rates from all respiratory diseases decreased in the past decade, hospitalization rates remained unchanged. Unlike other respiratory diseases, mortality from respiratory infections have increased since 2001. Smoking is the most important risk factor in non-communicable respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory disease is responsible for the highest health-care burden locally. Increased efforts in improving management and prevention of these diseases, including tobacco control, improving air quality and vaccination against influenza and pneumococci, are necessary.\"\n",

      "\"Symetis Acurate Transapical Aortic Valve: the initial experience with a second generation of transcatheter aortic valve replacement device.BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has proven to be a valuable alternative to conventional surgical aortic valve replacement in high risk and surgically in operable patients who suffer from severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, a significant number of complications, associated with both the learning curve and device specificity, have required attention and subsequent improvement. The Symetis transapical TAVR system is a self-positioning bioprosthesis composed of a non-coronary leaflet of surgical quality porcine tissue valve sewn into a self-expanding nitinol stent that iscovered with a PET-skirt. METHODS From June to September 2013 six patients have been operated on severe aortic stenosis using the new TAVR device. All patients have undergone critical assessment of a local Heart Team and have been disqualified from conventional AVR. Five were woman. Mean age was 82.3 ± 2.0 (mean LogEuroScore 23.9 ± 14.3). Four patients suffered from coronary artery disease - two had history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention with intracoronary stents, while the next two had history of coronary artery bypass grafting. Diabetes was frequent (n = 3) as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 4). Carotid artery disease was encountered in three patients similarly to atrial fibrillation. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 51.5 ± 11.8%, but one patient had suffered from low-flow-low-gradient aortic stenosis with LVEF of 29%. RESULTS The procedure was carried out successfully in all six cases. Two patients have received the valve sized L, three - M and one - S. Mean procedure time was 180 ± 19 min, mean cine 7.2 ± 1.2 min. Mean X-ray dose 930 ± 439 mGy, while mean volume of contrast given was 135 ± 61 mL. In all patients but one perivalvular leak (PVL) was not present. One patient had trace of PVL. Also, good LVEF was noted in all patients. Similar findings were obtained 30 days post procedure. No strokes, transient ischaemic attack or other cerebrovascular incidents were observed. CONCLUSIONS This brief clinical communication reports the first Polish experience with the second generation of TAVR device - the Symetis Acurate Transapical Aortic Valve. While it lacks large patient population and longer follow-up, it reveals that TAVR procedure can be performed safely, with minimal X-ray exposure time and contrast given and successfully - with almost nonexistent PVL and no cerebrovascular incidents or heart rhythm disturbances. Heart Team approach is vital, and transapical access should not be treated inferiorly, but rather as an equally appealing TAVR option.\"\n",

      "\"SARS Immunity and Vaccination.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious and fatal infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-Cov), a novel human coronavirus. SARS-Cov infection stimulates cytokines (e.g., IL-10, IFN-gamma, IL-1, etc.) expression dramatically, and T lymphocytes and their subsets CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are decreased after onset of the disease. SARS-specific IgG antibody is generated in the second week and persists for a long time, whereas IgM is expressed transiently. The spike protein and neucleocapsid protein are most abundant in SARS-Cov and contribute dominantly to the antibody production during the course of disease. Spike protein, especially the ACE-2 binding region (318-510aa) is capable of producing neutralizing antibody to SARS-Cov. Neucleocapsid protein induces protective specific CTL to SARS-Cov. Therefore, applications with spike subunit, neucleocapsid subunit as well as inactivated SARS-Cov are three prospective vaccination strategies for SARS.\"\n",

The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries. Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.\"\n",

Meanwhile the Center for Disease Control guidance for air exchange in between patients may heavily impact workflows. To design a portable custom isolation device to reduce imaging equipment contamination during a pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Center for Disease Control air exchange guidelines and requirements were reviewed. Device functional requirements were outlined and designed. Engineering requirements were reviewed. Methods of practice and risk mitigation plans were outlined including donning and doffing procedures and failure modes. Cost impact was assessed in terms of CT patient throughput. RESULTS: CT air exchange solutions and alternatives were reviewed. Multiple isolation bag device designs were considered. Several designs were custom fabricated, prototyped and reduced to practice. A final design was tested on volunteers for comfort, test-fit, air seal, and breathability. Less than 14 times enhanced patient throughput was estimated, in an ideal setting, which could more than counterbalance the cost of the device itself. CONCLUSION: A novel isolation bag device is feasible for use in CT and might facilitate containment and reduce contamination in radiology departments during the COVID Pandemic.\"\n",

Telemedicine, which includes medical advice given over telephone, Internet, mobile phone applications or other similar ways, may be an efficient way to reduce transmission and pressure on medical institutions. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases for literature on the use of telemedicine for COVID-19, SARS and MERS. from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We included studies about the content of the consultation (such as symptoms, therapy and prevention, policy, public service), screening of suspected cases, the provision of advice given to those people who may have symptoms or contact history. We conducted meta-analyses on the main outcomes of the studies. Results: A total of 2041 articles were identified after removing duplicates. After reading the full texts, we finally included nine studies. People were most concerned about symptoms (64.2%), epidemic situation and public problems (14.5%), and psychological problems (10.3%) during COVID-19 epidemic. During the SARS epidemic, the proportions of people asking for consultation for symptoms, prevention and therapy, and psychological problems were 35.0%, 22.0%, and 23.0%, respectively. Two studies demonstrated that telemedicine can be used to screen the suspected patients and give advice. One study emphasized the limited possibilities to follow up people calling hotlines and difficulties in identifying all suspect cases. Conclusions: Telemedicine services should focus on the issues that the public is most concerned about, such as then symptoms, prevention and treatment of the disease, and provide reasonable advice to patients with symptoms or people with epidemic history.

      "\"An Innovative Ergometer to Measure Neuromuscular Fatigue Immediately after Cycling.PURPOSE When assessing neuromuscular fatigue (NMF) from dynamic exercise using large muscle mass (e.g., cycling), most studies have delayed measurement for 1 to 3 min after task failure. This study aimed to determine the reliability of an innovative cycling ergometer permitting the start of fatigue measurement within 1 s after cycling. METHODS Twelve subjects participated in two experimental sessions. Knee-extensor NMF was assessed by electrical nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation with both a traditional chair setup (PRE- and POST-Chair, 2 min postexercise) and the new cycling ergometer (PRE, every 3 min during incremental exercise and POST-Bike, at task failure). RESULTS The reduction in maximal voluntary contraction force POST-Bike (63% ± 12% PRE; P < 0.001) was not different between sessions and there was excellent reliability at PRE-Bike (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.97; coefficients of variation [CV], 3.2%) and POST-Bike. Twitch (Tw) and high-frequency paired-pulse (Db100) forces decreased to 53% ± 14% and 62% ± 9% PRE, respectively (P < 0.001). Both were reliable at PRE-Bike (Tw: ICC, 0.97; CV, 5.2%; Db100: ICC, 0.90; CV, 7.3%) and POST-Bike (Tw: ICC, 0.88; CV, 11.9; Db100: ICC, 0.62; CV, 9.0%). Voluntary activation did not change during the cycling protocol (P > 0.05). Vastus lateralis and rectus femoris M-wave and motor-evoked potential areas showed fair to excellent reliability (ICC, 0.45-0.88). The reduction in maximal voluntary contraction and Db100 was greater on the cycling ergometer than the isometric chair. CONCLUSIONS The innovative cycling ergometer is a reliable tool to assess NMF during and immediately postexercise. This will allow fatigue etiology during dynamic exercise with large muscle mass to be revisited in various populations and environmental conditions.\"\n",

Simultaneously, PET-CT demonstrated mediastinal lymph node metastases. Two months later, 4 courses of systemic chemotherapy(SOX)were provided as preoperative therapy. However, the outcome was PD; therefore, radical gastrectomy could not be performed. Two more months later, esophageal dysphagia developed. Mediastinal lymph nodes that compressed the esophagus and the primary lesion of the cardia were considered to be the causes of dysphagia, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization targeting those 2 lesions was performed. Cisplatin 20 mg, docetaxel 20 mg, and 5-FU 250mg were the drugs administered. These drugs were injected from the right bronchial artery, left gastric artery, and left phrenic artery, followed by mild embolization with HepaSphereTM. The mediastinal lymph nodes shrunk significantly, and dysphagia improved with 2 sessions. The primary lesion was found to have reduced in size with 6 sessions.

      "\"Hemagglutinin-targeting Artificial MicroRNAs Expressed by Adenovirus Protect Mice From Different Clades of H5N1 InfectionInfluenza virus (IV) is a continuously evolving virus that widely spreads in humans and contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality. Re-emergence of human infection with avian influenza virus H5N1 poses extra challenge to IV control. Artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated RNA interference has become a powerful antiviral approach due to its high specificity and rapid effect. Here, we designed several amiRNAs targeting the hemagglutinin gene of H5N1, a major determinant of pathogenicity. Expression and delivery efficiency were enhanced by presenting functional amiRNA with chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 (AdC68). One amiRNA, HA-1405, significantly limited H5N1 replication in vitro and inhibited 96.7% of clade 2.3.2 replication. AdC68-conjugated HA-1405 treatment remarkably decreased different clades of H5N1 plaque formation in Madin–Darby canine kidney cells. Moreover, prophylactic administration with rAd(HA-1405) markedly alleviated clinical symptoms and reduced ~3- to 40-folds of lung viral RNA copies against four clades of H5N1 in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. Our results further showed that rAd(HA-1405) conferred 70 and 40% immediate protection against lethal clade 2.3.2 and clade 2.3.4 H5N1 challenge, respectively. In conclusion, these data provided information that HA-targeting amiRNA delivered by AdC68 could be pursued as a potential agent for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses prevention.\"\n",

The causative pathogen was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (6 bacteria), multiple reverse transcription-PCR (MPCR; 11 viruses), bacterial culture, and serology. The initial chemotherapy was evaluated based on the pathogens identified using PCR. We found 27 viral cases (23.1%), 25 bacterial cases (21.4%), 45 mixed infections with virus and bacteria (38.5%), 10 Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8.5%), 7 mixed infections with M. pneumoniae and another pathogen (6.0%), 1 Chlamydophila pneumoniae (0.9%), and 2 unknown pathogens (1.7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 58 (49.5%) and 27 (23.0%) of the cases, respectively.

Sulbactam/ampicillin (n =61), carbapenems (n =12), and ceftriaxone (n =7) were selected for the patients suspected of having bacterial infections alone or mixed infections with bacterial and viruses in accordance with our criteria defined tentatively. For those with M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infections, azithromycin or minocycline was initially used. Treatments averaged 3–5 days. The empirical chemotherapy was improper in 9.4% of cases in relation to the etiologic agents finally identified. We conclude that rapid and comprehensive identification using PCR can provide optimal antimicrobial chemotherapy for CAP patients.\"\n",

      "\"The Effect of Mobile App Interventions on Influencing Healthy Maternal Behavior and Improving Perinatal Health Outcomes: Systematic Review.BACKGROUND Perinatal morbidity and mortality are significant public health issues with an enduring impact on the health and well-being of women and their families. Millions of pregnant women now download and use mobile applications to access, store, and share health information. However, little is known about the consequences. An investigation of their impact on perinatal health outcomes is particularly topical. OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of mobile app interventions during pregnancy on influencing healthy maternal behavior and improving perinatal health outcomes. METHODS Searches of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, WHO Global Health Library, POPLINE, and CABI Global Health were conducted with no date or language restrictions. Randomized and non-randomized studies were included if they reported perinatal health outcomes of interventions targeting pregnant women, using mobile apps compared with other communication modalities or with standard care. The primary outcome measure was the change in maternal behaviors (as defined by trial authors), by intervention goals. Two reviewers independently extracted data using standardized forms. RESULTS Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 456 participants were included. All studies targeted participants in early pregnancy; however, wide variation was evident in participant characteristics, intervention, and study outcomes measures. Three trials were based in hospital settings, comparing women using mobile apps with routine antenatal care. One community-based trial gave all participants a device to promote physical activity; the intervention arm was also given a mobile app. All studies reported data for the primary outcome measure, describing some benefit from the intervention compared with controls. However, few statistically significant primary or secondary outcomes were reported. Due to insufficient data, the planned meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were not performed. CONCLUSIONS Due to limited numbers, heterogeneity of interventions, comparators, and outcome measures, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the effects of mobile application interventions during pregnancy on maternal knowledge, behavior change, and perinatal health outcomes. As millions of women utilize mobile apps during pregnancy, rigorous studies are essential for health care and maternity care providers to optimally design, implement, and evaluate interventions.\"\n",

      "\"The protective and pathogenic roles of IL-17 in viral infections: friend or foe?Viral infections cause substantial human morbidity and mortality, and are a significant health burden worldwide. Following a viral infection, the host may initiate complex antiviral immune responses to antagonize viral invasion and replication. However, proinflammatory antiviral immune responses pose a great threat to the host if not properly held in check. Interleukin (IL)-17 is a pleiotropic cytokine participating in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including tissue integrity maintenance, cancer progression, autoimmune disease development and, more intriguingly, infectious diseases. Abundant evidence suggests that while IL-17 plays a crucial role in enhancing effective antiviral immune responses, it may also promote and exacerbate virus-induced illnesses. Accumulated experimental and clinical evidence has broadened our understanding of the seemingly paradoxical role of IL-17 in viral infections and suggests that IL-17-targeted immunotherapy may be a promising therapeutic option. Herein, we summarize current knowledge regarding the protective and pathogenic roles of IL-17 in viral infections, with emphasis on underlying mechanisms. The various and critical roles of IL-17 in viral infections necessitate the development of therapeutic strategies that are uniquely tailored to both the infectious agent and the infection environment.\"\n",

      "\"Association of swine influenza H1N1 pandemic virus (SIV-H1N1p) with porcine respiratory disease complex in sows from commercial pig farms in ColombiaPorcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is a serious health problem that mainly affects growing and finishing pigs. PRDC is caused by a combination of viral and bacterial agents, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Myh), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), Pasteurella multocida and Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2). To characterize the specific role of swine influenza virus in PRDC presentation in Colombia, 11 farms from three major production regions in Colombia were examined in this study. Nasal swabs, bronchial lavage and lung tissue samples were obtained from animals displaying symptoms compatible with SIV. Isolation of SIV was performed in 9-day embryonated chicken eggs or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. Positive isolates, identified via the hemagglutination inhibition test, were further analyzed using PCR. Overall, 7 of the 11 farms were positive for SIV. Notably, sequencing of the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein led to grouping of strains into circulating viruses identified during the human outbreak of 2009, classified as pandemic H1N1-2009. Serum samples from 198 gilts and multiparous sows between 2008 and 2009 were obtained to determine antibody presence of APP, Myh, PCV2 and PRRSV in both SIV-H1N1p-negative and -positive farms, but higher levels were recorded for SIV-H1N1p-positive farms. Odds ratio (OR) and P values revealed statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in PRDC presentation in gilts and multiparous sows of farms positive for SIV-H1N1p. Our findings indicate that positive farms have increased risk of PRDC presentation, in particular, PCV2, APP and Myh.\"\n",

      "\"Viral respiratory infection in schoolchildren: effects on middle ear pressure.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of uncomplicated viral respiratory infections (colds) on middle ear pressure in healthy school-aged children. METHODS Children (ages 2-12) with normal tympanograms before onset of illness had bilateral tympanometry daily except weekends for 2 weeks after the onset of a cold. Nasopharyngeal secretion obtained at onset of illness was cultured for bacterial pathogens of otitis media using selective agars and tested for rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza 1-3 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technology. Tympanometry was designated as abnormal with peak pressure of < or =-100 daPa or > or =50 daPa and/or a compliance peak of < 0.2 cm(3). RESULTS Eighty-six colds were studied, 82 in schoolchildren (5-12 years old) and 4 in 2- to 3-year-olds. Abnormal negative middle ear pressure occurred at least once during the 2 weeks after onset in 57 (66%) of the 86 colds. Tympanometry was abnormal in the first week after onset in 50 (88%) of the 57 colds and was abnormal on a single day in 17 (30%) of the 57. The middle ear pressure abnormalities were intermittent and shifted from one ear to the other ear from day to day. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was positive for a respiratory virus in 56 (65%) of the 86 illnesses. Rhinovirus was found in 48% and respiratory syncytial virus in 14%. Pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis) were detected in nasopharyngeal secretion in 29 (34%) of the 86 colds; the bacteria were in high titer (> or =10(3) cfu/mL) in 26 of the 29 positive specimens. None developed illness that required a visit to a physician. Age, detection of a respiratory virus, and presence of bacterial pathogen in the nasopharyngeal secretion had a negligible effect on the occurrence of abnormal tympanometry. Occurrence of negative middle ear pressure in winter-spring colds was significantly greater than in fall colds for unexplained reasons. CONCLUSIONS Transient negative middle ear pressure occurred in two thirds of uncomplicated colds in healthy children. This negative pressure, which may facilitate secondary viral or bacterial otitis media, seems to result from viral infection of the nasopharynx and distal tube causing bilateral eustachian tube dysfunction. Tympanometry provides an objective measure of the potential beneficial effects of investigational treatments on the risk of eustachian tube dysfunction/otitis media.\"\n",

      "\"Risk Factors for Growth of Intracranial Aneurysms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Understanding risk factors for intracranial aneurysm growth is important for patient management. We performed a meta-analysis examining risk factors for intracranial aneurysm growth in longitudinal studies and examined the association between aneurysm growth and rupture. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched the literature for longitudinal studies of patients with unruptured aneurysms. We examined the associations of demographics, multiple aneurysms, prior subarachnoid hemorrhage, family history of aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage, smoking, and hypertension; and aneurysm shape, size, and location with aneurysm growth. We studied the association between aneurysm growth and rupture. A meta-analysis was performed by using a random-effects model by using summary statistics from included studies. RESULTS Twenty-one studies including 3954 patients with 4990 aneurysms with 13,294 aneurysm-years of follow-up were included. The overall proportion of growing aneurysms was 3.0% per aneurysm-year (95% CI, 2.0%-4.0%). Patient risk factors for growth included age older than 50 years (3.8% per year versus 0.9% per year, P < .01), female sex (3.2% per year versus 1.3% per year, P < .01), and smoking history (5.5% per year versus 3.5% per year, P < .01). Characteristics associated with higher growth rates included cavernous carotid artery location (14.4% per year), nonsaccular shape (14.7% per year versus 5.2% per year for saccular, P < .01), and aneurysm size (P < .01). Aneurysm growth was associated with a rupture rate of 3.1% per year compared with 0.1% per year for stable aneurysms (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS Observational evidence provided multiple clinical and anatomic risk factors for aneurysm growth, including age older than 50 years, female sex, smoking history, and nonsaccular shape. These findings should be considered when counseling patients regarding the natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.\"\n",

However, the impact of T cell-expressed miR-155 on immune cell dynamics in solid tumors remains unclear. In the present study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to define the CD45+ immune cell populations at different time points within B16F10 murine melanoma tumors growing in either wild-type or miR-155 T cell conditional knockout (TCKO) mice. miR-155 was required for optimal T cell activation and reinforced the T cell response at the expense of infiltrating myeloid cells. Further, myeloid cells from tumors growing in TCKO mice were defined by an increase in wound healing genes and a decreased IFN-γ-response gene signature. Finally, we found that miR-155 expression predicted a favorable outcome in human melanoma patients and was associated with a strong immune signature. Moreover, gene expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data revealed that miR-155 expression also correlates with an immune-enriched subtype in 29 other human solid tumors. Together, our study provides an unprecedented analysis of the cell types and gene expression signatures of immune cells within experimental melanoma tumors and elucidates the role of miR-155 in coordinating antitumor immune responses in mammalian tumors.\"\n",

      "\"Determining Significant Factors Affecting Vaccine Demand and Factor Relationships Using Fuzzy DEMATEL MethodEven though deadly effects of outbreaks such as SARS, H1N1, EBOLA and COVID-19 took the attention of the community, generating 100% vaccination uptake from people who are expected to be affected by such outbreaks is almost impossible. Hence, determining the actual vaccine demand for typical viruses and reaching this population are becoming important issues to prevent from spreading such viruses like wildfire. Many countries have been forecasting vaccine demand according to birth rates. However, factors such as district-level per capita income, literacy rate, urbanization, and some other factors should also be considered for more accurate forecasts. There is another factor affecting countries’ vaccine demand; some of the vaccines that WHO recommends are included in the national immunization programs, while others are only recommended. Thus, this study first aims to explore the most significant factors that affect the demand of vaccines that are not included in national immunization campaigns then to present the cause and effect relationships among the factors using the fuzzy DEMATEL method to provide insights to managers for better vaccine demand forecast and to increase vaccine uptake.

Hendra and Nipah viruses (henipaviruses within this family) were first identified in the 1990s in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore, causing epidemics with high mortality and morbidity rates in affected animals and humans. Other paramyxoviruses, such as Menangle virus, Tioman virus, human metapneumovirus and avian paramyxovirus 1, which cause less morbidity in humans, have also been recently identified. Although the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses has been previously recognised as biomedically and veterinarily important, the recent emergence of these paramyxoviruses has focused our attention on this family. Antiviral drugs can be designed to target specific important determinants of the viral life cycle. Therefore, identifying and understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of viral entry, replication, assembly and budding will be critical in the development of antiviral therapeutic agents.

During the initial epidemic in England, virus testing for older adults was restricted to symptomatic hospitalized patients. We aimed to estimate associations between pre-existing diagnoses and COVID-19 status, in a large community cohort. Methods: UK Biobank (England) participants assessed 2006 to 2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017. Demographic and pre-existing common diagnoses association tested with COVID-19 status (16th March to 14th April 2020) in logistic models, adjusted for demographics, study site and other diagnoses. Results: There were 274,356 participants aged 65+, including 448 (0.16%) hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Common co-morbidities in patients were hypertension (58.5%), coronary heart disease (CHD, 21.1%), history of fall or fragility fractures (30.6%), and type 2 diabetes (19.6%). However, in adjusted models, COVID-19 patients were more likely than other participants to have pre-existing dementia (OR=3.07 95% CI 1.71 to 5.50), COPD (OR= 1.82 CI 1.33 to 2.49), depression (OR=1.81 CI 1.36 to 2.40), type 2 diabetes (OR=1.70 CI 1.30 to 2.21), chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation. Hypertension was modestly associated (OR=1.29 CI 1.04 to 1.59), but CHD (OR=0.92 CI 0.71 to 1.20) prevalence was similar in COVID-19 patients and other participants. Conclusion: Specific co-morbidities are disproportionally common in older adults who develop severe COVID-19. Tailored interventions may be needed, as these results do not support simple age-based targeting to prevent severe COVID-19 infection.\"\n",

      "\"Synergistic Activity of Ceragenins Against Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Strains in Both Checkerboard and Dynamic Time-Kill AssaysAcinetobacter baumannii is an emerging opportunistic pathogen that primarily infects critically ill patients in nosocomial settings and there is a need for identifying new alternative therapeutic agents against these organisms. Ceragenins are non-peptide, membrane-active agents that mimic the antimicrobial properties of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and affect the membrane permeability of microorganisms. The in vitro activities of CSA-8, CSA-13, CSA-44, CSA-131, CSA-138 either alone or in combination with colistin (sulphate) were determined against 25 carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of selected ceragenins and colistin against these isolates were measured by in vitro microbroth dilution techniques. Checkerboard techniques and time-kill assays were performed to determine the activities of combinations. The MIC(50) values (mg/L) of CSA-8, CSA-13, CSA-44, CSA-131, CSA-138 and colistin were 32, 4, 8, 2, 4 and 0.5, respectively. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of CSA-8, CSA-13, CSA-44, CSA-131, CSA-138 and colistin were 128, 8, 16, 8, 16 and 16, respectively. At 6 h, 1×MIC and 2×MIC of CSA-13 were bactericidal. CSA-13 + colistin combination displayed synergistic interaction. Antagonism between antimicrobials was not observed. According to the results, CSA-13 and CSA-131 can be good alternatives for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.\"\n",

      "\"Controls to Minimize Disruption of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain during the Covid-19 PandemicThis article reviews currently available scientific literature related to the epidemiology, infectivity, survival, and susceptibility to disinfectants of Coronaviruses, in the context of the controls established to meet Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and guidance, and the public health guidance issued specifically to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. The possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pharmaceutical supply chain is assessed and recommendations are listed for risk mitigation steps to minimize supply disruption to pharmaceutical drug products. Areas addressed include a brief history of the COVID-19 viral pandemic, a description of the virus, the regulatory response to the pandemic, the screening of employees, the persistence on inanimate surfaces, cleaning and disinfection of manufacturing facilities, use of GMP-mandated personal protective equipment to counter the spread of the disease, the role of air changes in viral clearance, approaches to risk assessment and mitigation. Biological medicinal products have a great record of safety, yet the cell cultures used for production can be susceptible to viruses, and contamination events have occurred. Studies on SARS-CoV-1 for its ability to replicate in various mammalian cell lines used for biopharmaceutical manufacturing suggest SARS-CoV-2 poses low risk and any contamination would be detected by currently used adventitious virus testing. The consequences of the potential virus exposure of manufacturing processes, as well as the effectiveness of mitigation efforts are discussed. The pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, traversing many geographies and companies that range from large multinationals to mid and small size operations. This paper recommends practices that can be adopted by all companies, irrespective of their size, geographic location, or position in the supply chain.\"\n",

      "\"First identification of a single amino acid change in the spike protein region of feline coronavirus detected from a coronavirus-associated cutaneous nodule in a catCASE SUMMARY: A 32-month-old spayed female Singapura cat presented with a non-pruritic erythematous nodule on the upper lip. The cat also had multiple nodules in the liver but exhibited no other clinical signs consistent with classical feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), such as pleural effusion or ascites, uveitis or neurological symptoms. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of the cutaneous nodule revealed pyogranulomatous dermatitis with intralesional macrophages laden with feline coronavirus (FCoV) antigen. Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of a cutaneous sample revealed a single nucleotide substitution in the spike protein gene of FCoV (mutation M1058L), which is consistent with an FCoV genotype commonly associated with FIP. The cat received a blood transfusion and supportive therapy, but the owner declined to continue the treatments owing to poor response. The cat was lost to follow-up 5 months after discharge. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: This report describes a case of a coronavirus-associated cutaneous nodule in which the evidence of amino acid changes in the spike protein gene identified by RT-PCR were consistent with an FCoV genotype commonly seen in cases of FIP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of cutaneous disease associated with the mutated FCoV that was confirmed by molecular diagnostic testing.\"\n",

      "\"Isolation of bovine coronavirus (bcoV) in vero cell line and its confirmation by direct FAT and RT-PCR.Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world. The virus is one of the largest RNA virus and has specific tropism for intestinal and pulmonary epithelial cells. It is responsible for huge economic losses by causing winter dysentery in adult dairy cattle and respiratory and intestinal tract infections leading to pneumo-enteritis in young calves. Isolation of BCoV has been reported to be difficult. Studies regarding epidemiology, virus isolation and molecular detection from India are very few. In the present study Vero cell line was used for isolation of the BCoV from Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) positive samples. Direct florescent antibody technique (dFAT) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to confirm the isolated virus strains at antigenic and genomic levels, respectively. Out of the 15 positive fecal samples, virus from only seven was able to infect vero cell line. Subsequently BCoV got adapted to the vero cell line upto three passages, which was confirmed both at genomic and antigenic levels by dFAT and RT-PCR testing. It can be concluded that vero cell line can be used for isolation of BCoV, however due to the enormous stain diversity of the virus it is possible that many stains can't grow and get adapt in this cell line. Further studies are required for isolation of different viral strains, finding the susceptible cell lines and also to confirm the variations among the BCoV isolates at antigenic/genomic levels.\"\n",

As part of improving surveillance in the region, the BioCaster project aims to develop a system based on text mining for automatically monitoring Internet news and other online sources in several regional languages. At the heart of the system is an application ontology which serves the dual purpose of enabling advanced searches on the mined facts and of allowing the system to make intelligent inferences for assessing the priority of events. However, it became clear early on in the project that existing classification schemes did not have the necessary language coverage or semantic specificity for our needs. In this article we present an overview of our needs and explore in detail the rationale and methods for developing a new conceptual structure and multilingual terminological resource that focusses on priority pathogens and the diseases they cause.

When implemented in full and without delay, isolation is very effective. However, flawless implementation is seldom feasible in practice. We present an epidemic model called SIQ with an isolation protocol, focusing on the consequences of delays and incomplete identification of infected hosts. The continuum limit of this model is a system of Delay Differential Equations, the analysis of which reveals clearly the dependence of epidemic evolution on model parameters including disease reproductive number, isolation probability, speed of identification of infected hosts and recovery rates. Our model offers estimates on minimum response capabilities needed to curb outbreaks, and predictions of endemic states when containment fails. Critical response capability is expressed explicitly in terms of parameters that are easy to obtain, to assist in the evaluation of funding priorities involving preparedness and epidemics management.\"\n",

We aimed to determine hospital mortality and the factors associated with it in a cohort of MERS-CoV patients. METHODS: We reviewed hospital records of confirmed cases (detection of virus by polymerase chain reaction from respiratory tract samples) of MERS-CoV patients (n = 63) admitted to Buraidah Central Hospital in Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia between 2014 and 2017. We abstracted data on demography, vital signs, associated conditions presented on admission, pre-existing chronic diseases, treatment, and vital status. Bi-variate comparisons and multiple logistic regressions were the choice of data analyses. RESULTS: The mean age was 60 years (SD = 18.2); most patients were male (74.6%) and Saudi citizens (81%). All but two patients were treated with Ribavirin plus Interferon. Hospital mortality was 25.4%. Patients who were admitted with septic shock and/or organ failure were significantly more likely to die than patients who were admitted with pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR = 47.9, 95% CI = 3.9, 585.5, p-value 0.002). Age, sex, and presence of chronic conditions were not significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Hospital mortality was 25%; septic shock/organ failure at admittance was a significant predictor of mortality.\"\n",

      "\"Review: 2-mercaptoethanol alteration of in vitro immune functions of species other than murineDescriptions that organosulfurs could alter biologically relevant cellular functions began some 40 years ago when cell mediated and humoral murine in vitro immune responses were reported to be dramatically enhanced by any of four xenobiotic, sulfhydryl compounds—2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), dithiothreitol, glutathione, and L-cysteine; the most effective of the four was 2-ME. These findings triggered a plethora of reports defining 2-ME benefits for a multitude of immunological processes, primarily with murine models. This led to investigations on 2-ME alterations of (a) immune functions in other species, (b) activities of other cell-types, and (c) in situ diseases. In addition, the early findings may have been instrumental in identification of the previously undefined anticarcinogenic chemicals in specific foods as organosulfurs. Outside the plant organosulfurs, there are no comprehensive reviews of these areas to help define mechanisms by which organosulfurs function as well as identify potential alternative uses. Therefore, the present review will focus on 2-ME alterations of in vitro immune functions in species other than murine; namely, fish, amphibian, reptile, avian, whales, dolphins, rat, hamster, rabbit, guinea pig, feline, canine, porcine, ovine, bovine, and human. Processes, some unique to a given species, were in general, enhanced and in some cases dependent upon the presence of 2-ME. The largest benefits occurred in media that were serum free, followed by those in autologous serum and then fetal bovine serum supplemented medium. Concentrations of 2-ME were generally in the low μM range, with exceptions of those for salamander (20 mM), turtles (70 mM) and dolphins (7 mM). The few studies designed to assess mechanisms found that changes induced by 2-ME were generally accompanied by alterations of reduced/oxidized glutathione cellular concentrations. The major benefit for most studies, however, was to increase the sensitivity of the culture environment, which permitted a specific process to be more easily dissected.\"\n",

The recent assignment of 60 previously unknown HRV types to a third HRV species, Human rhinovirus C, raised questions about the prevalence of these picornavirus types in the community, the extent of HRV diversity at a single site, and whether the HRVs have an equally diverse clinical impact on their hosts. We quantified HRV diversity, and there was no clinical impact attributable to HRV species and genotypes among a community population of preschool-aged children with ARI who provided respiratory samples during 2003. All HRV species were represented among 138 children with ARI, and 74 distinct HRV types were cocirculating. Fever accompanied 32.8% of HRV-positive ARI cases. HRVs were less likely than DNA viruses to be codetected with another virus, suggesting virus interference at the community level, demonstrated by the inverse correlation between influenza virus detection and HRV detection.\"\n",

      "\"Running out? Rethinking resource depletion.Since the 1970s, environmentalists have warned that overconsumption, especially of minerals and fossil fuels, will lead to resource depletion. But there are compelling reasons to question the assertion that we are running out. On the one hand, new technologies and discoveries have increased the supply of petroleum and natural gas. On the other, concerns about global climate change and the competitiveness of renewable energy are turning coal into a sunset industry and threaten to transform oil reserves into stranded assets. In contrast to fossil fuels, which are consumed in the process of generating energy, virtually all of the metals excavated in the past remain available even after they have been put to use. Even though the average size and degree of mineralization of recently-discovered ore bodies is on the decline, there has never been as much copper, silver, and gold available for human consumption as there is today. Whether incorporated into digital technology or infrastructure, the majority of metals remain available for recycling, which is generally less expensive, uses less energy, and has fewer environmental impacts than extracting minerals from the earth. The threat posed by climate change from continued use of fossil fuels, and the impacts of environmental degradation caused by resource extraction, demand greater attention than the misleading specter of peak oil or running out of metals.\"\n",

We report the discovery and characterization of small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication that block viral entry by three different mechanisms. The compounds were discovered by screening a chemical library of compounds for blocking of entry of HIV-1 pseudotyped with SARS-CoV surface glycoprotein S (SARS-S) but not that of HIV-1 pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus surface glycoprotein G (VSV-G). Studies on their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 {N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[(Z)-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [N-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane. Our work demonstrates that there are at least three independent strategies for blocking SARS-CoV entry, validates these mechanisms of inhibition, and introduces promising leads for the development of SARS therapeutics.\"\n",

MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR PREDICTION OF MOUSE LIFESPANPrediction of individual lifespan based upon characteristics evaluated at middle-age represents a challenging objective for aging research. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to construct models that predict lifespan in a stock of genetically heterogeneous mice. Lifespan-prediction accuracy of 22 algorithms was evaluated using a cross-validation approach, in which models were trained and tested with distinct subsets of data. Using a combination of body weight and T-cell subset measures evaluated before two years of age, we show that the lifespan quartile to which an individual mouse belongs can be predicted with an accuracy of 35.3% (± 0.10%). This result provides a new benchmark for the development of lifespan-predictive models, but improvement can be expected through identification of new predictor variables and development of computational approaches.

      "\"Development and Validation of a Scoring System for Predicting Periprocedural Complications During Percutaneous Coronary Interventions of Chronic Total Occlusions: The Prospective Global Registry for the Study of Chronic Total Occlusion Intervention (PROGRESS CTO) Complications Score.BACKGROUND High success rates are achievable for chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using the hybrid approach, but periprocedural complications remain of concern. Although scores estimating success and efficiency in CTO PCI have been developed, there is currently no available score for estimation of the risk for periprocedural complications. We sought to develop a scoring tool for prediction of periprocedural complications during CTO PCI. METHODS AND RESULTS We analyzed data from 1569 CTO PCIs in the Prospective Global Registry for the Study of Chronic Total Occlusion Intervention (PROGRESS CTO) using a derivation and validation sampling ratio of 2:1. Variables independently associated with periprocedural complications in multivariable analysis in the derivation set were assigned points based on their respective odds ratios. Forty-four (2.8%) patients experienced complications. Three factors were independent predictors of complications and were included in the score: patient age >65 years, +3 points (odds ratio, OR=4.85, CI 1.82-16.77); lesion length ≥23 mm, +2 points (OR=3.22, CI 1.08-13.89); and use of the retrograde approach +1 point (OR=2.41, CI 1.04-6.05). The resulting score showed good calibration and discriminatory capacity in the derivation (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 6.271, P=0.281, receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] area=0.758) and validation (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 4.551, P=0.473, ROC area=0.793) sets. Score values of 0 to 2, 3 to 4, and ≥5 were defined as low, intermediate, and high risk of complications (derivation cohort 0.4%, 1.8%, 6.5%, P<0.001; validation cohort 0.0%, 2.5%, 6.8%, P<0.001).

      "\"Nidovirus papain-like proteases: multifunctional enzymes with protease, deubiquitinating and deISGylating activitiesCoronaviruses and arteriviruses, members of the order Nidovirales, are positive strand RNA viruses that encode large replicase polyproteins that are processed by viral proteases to generate the nonstructural proteins which mediate viral RNA synthesis. The viral papain-like proteases (PLPs) are critical for processing the amino-terminal end of the replicase and are attractive targets for antiviral therapies. With the analysis of the papain-like protease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), came the realization of the multifunctional nature of these enzymes. Structural and enzymatic studies revealed that SARS-CoV PLpro can act as both a protease to cleave peptide bonds and also as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme to cleave the isopeptide bonds found in polyubiquitin chains. Furthermore, viral DUBs can also remove the protective effect of conjugated ubiquitin-like molecules such as interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). Extension of these studies to other coronaviruses and arteriviruses led to the realization that viral protease/DUB activity is conserved in many family members. Overexpression studies revealed that viral protease/DUB activity can modulate or block activation of the innate immune response pathway. Importantly, mutations that alter DUB activity but not viral protease activity have been identified and arteriviruses expressing DUB mutants stimulated higher levels of acute inflammatory cytokines after infection. Further understanding of the multifunctional nature of the Nidovirus PLP/DUBs may facilitate vaccine development. Here, we review studies describing the PLPs’ enzymatic activity and their role in virus pathogenesis.\"\n",

      "\"Crystal structure and activity-based labeling reveal the mechanisms for linkage-specific substrate recognition by deubiquitinase USP9XUSP9X is a conserved deubiquitinase (DUB) that regulates multiple cellular processes. Dysregulation of USP9X has been linked to cancers and X-linked intellectual disability. Here, we report the crystal structure of the USP9X catalytic domain at 2.5-Å resolution. The structure reveals a canonical USP-fold comprised of fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains, as well as an unusual β-hairpin insertion. The catalytic triad of USP9X is aligned in an active configuration. USP9X is exclusively active against ubiquitin (Ub) but not Ub-like modifiers. Cleavage assays with di-, tri-, and tetraUb chains show that the USP9X catalytic domain has a clear preference for K11-, followed by K63-, K48-, and K6-linked polyUb chains. Using a set of activity-based diUb and triUb probes (ABPs), we demonstrate that the USP9X catalytic domain has an exo-cleavage preference for K48- and endo-cleavage preference for K11-linked polyUb chains. The structure model and biochemical data suggest that the USP9X catalytic domain harbors three Ub binding sites, and a zinc finger in the fingers subdomain and the β-hairpin insertion both play important roles in polyUb chain processing and linkage specificity. Furthermore, unexpected labeling of a secondary, noncatalytic cysteine located on a blocking loop adjacent to the catalytic site by K11-diUb ABP implicates a previously unreported mechanism of polyUb chain recognition. The structural features of USP9X revealed in our study are critical for understanding its DUB activity.

      "\"New partnerships between animal health services and public health agencies.As Veterinary Services and animal health organisations attempt to respond to a new era of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases, their ability and skill in forming new strategic partnerships will be paramount. While these new partnerships are likely to include many relationships outside traditional Veterinary Services and animal agriculture, none will become more important than the formation of new animal health and public health partnerships. Episodes of emerging zoonoses are being increasingly recognised around the world and the confluence of people, animals and animal products today is unprecedented. Concurrently, a wide array of complex factors are also converging that will not only ensure the continuous emergence of zoonoses, but are also likely to drive the further increase and expansion of these diseases. This article discusses the need for the creation of more effective and co-operative partnerships in the face of new microbial threats, the complexity of both the formation and expansion of zoonoses, and the collective abilities of both human and animal health services to respond to them. Lessons learned from recent zoonotic epidemics supportthe need for co-ordinated research, interdisciplinary centres, integrated surveillance systems, response systems and infrastructures, and workforce development strategies. While there are some excellent examples of collaborative animal and public health relationships, there is no question that more and stronger partnerships among national and international organisations, both academic and private, will be necessary to meet the future challenges of emerging zoonoses and to manage their profound implications.\"\n",

      "\"Effects of non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure excluding post-extubation respiratory failure, cardiogenic pulmonary edema and exacerbation of COPD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND This meta-analysis compared the effects of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with invasive mechanical ventilation (InMV) and standard oxygen (O2) therapy on mortality and rate of tracheal intubation in patients presenting acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials databases between 1949 and May 2015 to identify randomized trials of NIV for ARF. We excluded the ARF caused by extubation, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and COPD. RESULTS The meta-analysis included 21 studies and 1691 patients, of whom 846 were assigned to NIV and 845 to control (InMV or standard O2 therapy). One hundred ninety-one patients (22.6%) in the NIV group and 261 patients (30.9%) in the control group died before discharge from hospital. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for short-term mortality (in-hospital mortality) was 0.56 (95% CI 0.40-0.78). When comparing NIV with standard O2 therapy, the short-term mortality was 155 (27.4%) versus 204 (36.0%), respectively. For this comparison, the pooled OR of short-term mortality was 0.56 (95% CI 0.36-0.85). When comparing NIV with InMV, the short-term mortality was 36 (12.9%) versus 57 (20.5%) patients, respectively. For this comparison, the pooled OR of short-term mortality was 0.56 (95% CI 0.34-0.90). Tracheal intubation was performed in 106 patients (22.7%) in the NIV and in 183 patients (39.4%) in the standard O2 group, representing a pooled OR of 0.37 (95% CI 0.25-0.55). There were publication biases and the quality of the evidence was graded as low. CONCLUSION Compared with standard O2 therapy or InMV, NIV lowered both the short-term mortality and the rate of tracheal intubation in patients presenting with ARF.\"\n",

      "\"Influence of Community and Culture in the Ethical Allocation of Scarce Medical Resources in a Pandemic Situation: Deliberative Democracy StudyBACKGROUND: Stark gaps exist between projected health needs in a pandemic situation and the current capacity of health care and medical countermeasure systems. Existing pandemic ethics discussions have advocated to engage the public in scarcity dilemmas and attend the local contexts and cultural perspectives that shape responses to a global health threat. This public engagement study thus considers the role of community and culture in the ethical apportionment of scarce health resources, specifically ventilators, during an influenza pandemic. It builds upon a previous exploration of the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza. An important finding of this earlier research was that local history and place within the state engendered different ways of thinking about scarcity. OBJECTIVE: Given the intrastate variation in the themes expressed by Maryland participants, the project team sought to examine interstate differences by implementing the same protocol elsewhere to answer the following questions. Does variation in ethical frames of reference exist within different regions of the United States? What practical implications does evidence of sameness and difference possess for pandemic planners and policymakers at local and national levels? METHODS: Research using the same deliberative democracy process from the Maryland study was conducted in Central Texas in March 2018 among 30 diverse participants, half of whom identified as Hispanic or Latino. Deliberative democracy provides a moderated process through which community members can learn facts about a public policy matter from experts and explore their own and others’ views. RESULTS: Participants proposed that by evenly distributing supplies of ventilators and applying clear eligibility criteria consistently, health authorities could enable fair allocation of scarce lifesaving equipment. The strong identification, attachment, and obligation of persons toward their nuclear and extended families emerged as a distinctive regional and ethnic core value that has practical implications for the substance, administration, and communication of allocation frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Maryland and Central Texas residents expressed a common, overriding concern about the fairness of allocation decisions. Central Texas deliberants, however, more readily expounded upon family as a central consideration. In Central Texas, family is a principal, culturally inflected lens through which life and death matters are often viewed. Conveners of other pandemic-related public engagement exercises in the United States have advocated the benefits of transparency and inclusivity in developing an ethical allocation framework; this study demonstrates cultural competence as a further advantage.\"\n",

      "\"Studying copy number variations using a nanofluidic platformCopy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are conventionally detected using high-throughput scanning technologies, such as comparative genomic hybridization and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, or relatively low-throughput techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All these approaches are limited in resolution and can at best distinguish a twofold (or 50%) difference in copy number. We have developed a new technology to study copy numbers using a platform known as the digital array, a nanofluidic biochip capable of accurately quantitating genes of interest in DNA samples. We have evaluated the digital array's performance using a model system, to show that this technology is exquisitely sensitive, capable of differentiating as little as a 15% difference in gene copy number (or between 6 and 7 copies of a target gene). We have also analyzed commercial DNA samples for their CYP2D6 copy numbers and confirmed that our results were consistent with those obtained independently using conventional techniques. In a screening experiment with breast cancer and normal DNA samples, the ERBB2 gene was found to be amplified in about 35% of breast cancer samples. The use of the digital array enables accurate measurement of gene copy numbers and is of significant value in CNV studies.\"\n",

Although it has been well established that cell‐surface SA acts as a primary attachment receptor for IAV, the particular receptor(s) or coreceptor(s) that mediate IAV entry into any cell, including MΦ and DC, have not been clearly defined. Identifying which receptors are involved in attachment and entry of IAV into immune cells may have important implications in regard to understanding IAV tropism and pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that specialized receptors on MΦ and DCs, namely CLRs, can act as capture and/or entry receptors for many viral pathogens, including IAV. Herein, we review the early stages of infection of MΦ and DC by IAV.

We aim to determine the impact of steroid use in COVID-19 pneumonia in-hospital mortality.Patients and Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study in a University hospital in Madrid, Spain, during March 2020. To determine the role of steroids in in-hospital mortality, patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and treated with steroids were compared to patients not treated with steroids, adjusting by a propensity-score for steroid treatment. Survival times were compared using log-rank test. Different steroid regimens were compared, and adjusted with a second propensity score.Results: During the study period, 463 out of 848 hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia fulfilled inclusion criteria. Among them, 396 (46.7%) patients were treated with steroids and 67 patients were not. Global mortality was 15.1%. Median time to steroid treatment from symptom onset was 10 days (IQR 8-13). In-hospital mortality was lower in patients treated with steroids than in controls (13.9% [55/396] versus 23.9% [16/67], HR 0.51 [0.27-0.96], p= 0.044). Steroid treatment reduced mortality by 41.8% relative to no steroid treatment (RRR 0,42 [0.048- 0.65). Initial treatment with 1 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone versus steroid pulses was not associated with in-hospital mortality (13.5% [42/310] versus 15.1% [13/86], OR 0.880 [0.449-1.726], p=0.710).Conclusions: Our results show that survival of patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia is higher in patients treated with glucocorticoids than in those not treated.

      "\"Relation between weight loss and causes of death in patients with cardiovascular disease: finding from the SCOUT trial.AIMS Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of mortality. The Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcomes (SCOUT) trial can provide the first evidence of the effect of intentional weight loss on mortality in an obese population at high risk. METHODS SCOUT was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing sibutramine vs. placebo. Eligibility for the trial required both men and women aged at least 55 years, with BMI of at least 27 kg/m and 45 kg/m or less. Study participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) only should have at least one other risk factor defined as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, or diabetic nephropathy, and/or they had a history of cardiovascular disease. Study participants were stratified in three groups: patients with T2DM, patients with a prior cardiovascular event but without diabetes, and patients with both T2DM and a prior cardiovascular event.The relationship between weight loss and mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular) was investigated with Cox regression models. RESULTS The main study showed that all-cause mortality was not different in patients allocated to sibutramine or placebo. This ancillary analysis demonstrates that there is a general trend showing higher mortality in patients with the greatest weight loss (weight reduction >10 kg) and in those with increasing weight (>1 kg). If integrated weight loss (area under the curve from baseline to 12 months) is used, these observations are confirmed. The impact of substantial weight loss on mortality is marked in those dying of noncardiovascular causes, specifically cancer.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty surgeons participated in this study and were distributed into three groups (novices, intermediate and experts). Each subject carried out suturing and dissection tasks on a physical simulator, using axial-handled or ring-handled instruments, respectively. Hand and wrist positions were registered by the CyberGlove® and a modified RULA method was applied to establish appropriate risk levels for wrist disorders. RESULTS We found statistically significant differences in seven of the eleven glove sensors when comparing both tasks. RULA method showed that all subjects, with the exception of the experts using an axial-handled instrument, assume a prejudicial wrist posture during the practice of suturing and dissection tasks on the simulator. CONCLUSIONS Data glove CyberGlove® allows for the distinction between two laparoscopic exercises performed with different instruments. Also, laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing when performed with an axial-handled needle holder entails a more ergonomic posture for the wrist joint.

      "\"Early dialogue with health technology assessment bodies: a European perspective.INTRODUCTION Evidence requirements may differ across HTA bodies, and so pharmaceutical companies must plan to synergize their evidence generation strategy, across global regulatory and HTA bodies. Until recently, companies had no official platform to discuss the clinical development of a drug with HTA bodies; however, this is changing. OBJECTIVES To achieve broad usage in the EU, products must achieve both regulatory and reimbursement approval, the latter of which is based on HTA appraisal in many markets. The objective of this study is to present and evaluate the different options available for early HTA consultation (during drug development/Phase III) in the major European markets from the industry perspective. METHODS An exploratory (nonsystematic) literature review was performed to identify the European markets offering early HTA consultations, and each process was analyzed using a set of predefined metrics that are relevant to industry (the ability to consult with the regulatory body in parallel, consultation fees, length of consultation meeting, language of consultation meeting, maximum number of pharmaceutical company employees attending, procedural timelines, nature of data for which consultative advice can be sought, the output of the process, and the ability to involve external experts). RESULTS Four different types of early HTA consultation processes were identified across the major European HTA markets. The nature of these processes varied in terms of the types and number of questions that can be addressed, the length of the meeting, the reporting output, and the ability to involve external experts. CONCLUSIONS The availability of various options for early HTA consultation may help to avoid a mismatch between the evidence generated by means of a product's clinical development program, and the evidence expected by HTA bodies and payers, which can facilitate the pricing and reimbursement process upon a product's market authorization.\"\n",

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery 2 is an observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. Participants were recruited between February 21, 2005, and February 17, 2009. Adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgical procedures as part of clinical care by participating surgeons between March 14, 2006, and April 24, 2009, were followed up for 3 years (through October 24, 2012). INTERVENTION Participants undergoing bariatric surgery completed research assessments before the procedure and annually thereafter. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The frequency and type of urinary incontinence episodes in the past 3 months were assessed using a validated questionnaire. Prevalent urinary incontinence was defined as at least weekly urinary incontinence episodes, and remission was defined as change from prevalent urinary incontinence at baseline to less than weekly urinary incontinence episodes at follow-up. RESULTS Of 2458 participants, 1987 (80.8%) completed baseline and follow-up assessments. At baseline, the median age was 47 years (age range, 18-78 years), the median body mass index was 46 kg/m2 (range, 34-94 kg/m2), and 1565 of 1987 (78.8%) were women. Urinary incontinence was more prevalent among women (49.3%; 95% CI, 46.9%-51.9%) than men (21.8%; 95% CI, 18.2%-26.1%) (P < .001). After a mean 1-year weight loss of 29.5% (95% CI, 29.0%-30.1%) in women and 27.0% (95% CI, 25.9%-28.6%) in men, year 1 urinary incontinence prevalence was significantly lower among women (18.3%; 95% CI, 16.4%-20.4%) and men (9.8%; 95% CI, 7.2%-13.4%) (P < .001 for all). The 3-year prevalence was higher than the 1-year prevalence for both sexes (24.8%; 95% CI, 21.8%-26.5% among women and 12.2%; 95% CI, 9.0%-16.4% among men) but was substantially lower than baseline (P < .001 for all). Weight loss was independently related to urinary incontinence remission (relative risk, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10 in women and 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13 in men) per 5% weight loss, as were younger age and the absence of a severe walking limitation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women and men with severe obesity, bariatric surgery was associated with substantially reduced urinary incontinence over 3 years. Improvement in urinary incontinence may be an important benefit of bariatric surgery.\"\n",

      "\"Poor-sleep is associated with slow recovery from lymphopenia and an increased need for ICU care in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A retrospective cohort studySleep is known to play an important role in immune function. However, the effects of sleep quality during hospitalization for COVID-19 remain unclear. This retrospective, single-center cohort study was conducted to investigate the effects of sleep quality on recovery from lymphopenia and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the West District of Wuhan Union Hospital between January 25 and March 15, 2020. The Richards-Campbell sleep questionnaire (RCSQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess sleep quality. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected from electronic medical records and compared between the good-sleep group and poor-sleep group. In all, 135 patients (60 in good-sleep group and 75 in poor-sleep group) were included in this study. There were no significant between-group differences regarding demographic and baseline characteristics, as well as laboratory parameters upon admission and in-hospital treatment. Compared with patients in the good-sleep group, patients in the poor-sleep group had lower absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (day 14: median, 1.10 vs 1.32, P = 0.0055; day 21: median, 1.18 vs 1.48, P = 0.0034) and its reduced recovery rate (day 14: median, 56.91 vs 69.40, P = 0.0255; day 21: median, 61.40 vs 111.47, P = 0.0003), as well as increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; day 14: median, 3.17 vs 2.44, P = 0.0284; day 21: median, 2.73 vs 2.23, P = 0.0092) and its associated deterioration rate (day 14: median, -39.65 vs -61.09, P = 0.0155; day 21: median, -51.40% vs -75.43, P = 0.0003). Nine [12.0%] patients in the poor-sleep group required ICU care (P = 0.0151); meanwhile, none of the patients in good-sleep group required ICU care. Patients in the poor-sleep group had increased duration of hospital stay (33.0 [23.0–47.0] days vs 25.0 [20.5–36.5] days, P = 0.0116) compared to those in the good-sleep group. An increased incidence of hospital-acquired infection (seven [9.3%] vs one [1.7%]) was observed in the poor-sleep group compared to the good-sleep group; however, this difference was not significant (P = 0.1316). In conclusion, poor sleep quality during hospitalization in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia is associated with a slow recovery from lymphopenia and an increased need for ICU care.\"\n",

      "\"Comparison of carina-based versus bony anatomy-based registration for setup verification in esophageal cancer radiotherapy.BACKGROUND To investigate the feasibility and geometric accuracy of carina-based registration for CBCT-guided setup verification in esophageal cancer IGRT, compared with current practice bony anatomy-based registration. METHODS Included were 24 esophageal cancer patients with 65 implanted fiducial markers, visible on planning CTs and follow-up CBCTs. All available CBCT scans (n = 236) were rigidly registered to the planning CT with respect to the bony anatomy and the carina. Target coverage was visually inspected and marker position variation was quantified relative to both registration approaches; the variation of systematic (Σ) and random errors (σ) was estimated. RESULTS Automatic carina-based registration was feasible in 94.9% of the CBCT scans, with an adequate target coverage in 91.1% compared to 100% after bony anatomy-based registration. Overall, Σ (σ) in the LR/CC/AP direction was 2.9(2.4)/4.1(2.4)/2.2(1.8) mm using the bony anatomy registration compared to 3.3(3.0)/3.6(2.6)/3.9(3.1) mm for the carina. Mid-thoracic placed markers showed a non-significant but smaller Σ in CC and AP direction when using the carina-based registration. CONCLUSIONS Compared with a bony anatomy-based registration, carina-based registration for esophageal cancer IGRT results in inadequate target coverage in 8.9% of cases. Furthermore, large Σ and σ, requiring larger anisotropic margins, were seen after carina-based registration. Only for tumors entirely confined to the mid-thoracic region the carina-based registration might be slightly favorable.\"\n",

      "\"Sequential kidney-liver transplantation from the same living donor for lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase deficiency.BACKGROUND Lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of lipoprotein metabolism that results in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) necessitating transplantation. As LCAT is produced in the liver, combined kidney and liver transplantation was proposed to cure the clinical syndrome of LCAT deficiency. METHODS A 29-year-old male with ESRD secondary to LCAT deficiency underwent a sequential kidney-liver transplantation from the same living donor (LD). One year following the kidney transplant, auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant (APOLT) of a left lateral segment from the same donor was performed. RESULTS At 5 years follow-up, there have been no major complications, readmissions, or rejection episodes. Serum lipid abnormalities recurred within the first year, but liver and kidney allograft function remains intact. CONCLUSION Few cases of sequential transplantation from the same LD have been performed in adults. This is the first APOLT and multi-organ transplant performed for LCAT deficiency. Sequential organ transplant from the same LD for ESRD secondary to a metabolic disorder of the liver is feasible in adults and should be further investigated.\"\n",

We considered three highly contagious viruses that infect a wide range of domestic and wild mammals: canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine enteric coronaviruses (CECoV). Infection by either one of these viruses can affect populations through increased mortality and/or decreased general health. We investigated infection in the wolf populations of Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise National Park (PNALM), Italy, and of Mercantour National Park (PNM), France. Faecal samples were collected during one winter, from October to March, from four packs in PNALM (n = 79) and from four packs in PNM (n = 66). We screened samples for specific sequences of viral nucleic acids. To our knowledge, our study is the first documented report of CECoV infection in wolves outside Alaska, and of the large-scale occurrence of CPV-2 in European wolf populations. The results suggest that CPV-2 is enzootic in the population of PNALM, but not in PNM and that CECoV is episodic in both areas. We did not detect CDV. Our findings suggest that density and spatial distribution of susceptible hosts, in particular free-ranging dogs, can be important factors influencing infections in wolves. This comparative study is an important step in evaluating the nature of possible disease threats in the studied wolf populations. Recent emergence of new viral strains in Europe additionally strengthens the need for proactive monitoring of wolves and other susceptible sympatric species for viral threats and other impairing infections.\"\n",

The 90th passage strain (YX10p90) was selected as the live-attenuated vaccine candidate strain. YX10p90 was found to be safe in 7-day-old specific pathogen free chickens without induction of morbidity or mortality. YX10p90 provided nearly complete protection against QX-like (CH I genotype) strains and partial protection against other two major Chinese genotype strains. YX10p90 also showed no reversion to virulence after five back passages in chickens. An IBV polyvalent vaccine containing YX10p90 was developed and showed that it could provide better protection against major Chinese IBV virulent strains than commercial polyvalent vaccines. In addition, the complete genome sequence of YX10p90 was sequenced. Multiple-sequence alignments identified 38 nucleotide substitutions in the whole genome which resulted in 26 amino acid substitutions and a 110-bp deletion in the 3′ untranslated region. In conclusion, the attenuated YX10p90 strain exhibited a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity, and should be considered as a candidate vaccine to prevent infection of Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV.\"\n",

      "\"Temperature in Nursing Home Residents Systematically Tested for SARS-CoV-2Abstract Objectives Many nursing home residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 fail to be identified with standard screening for the associated COVID-19 syndrome. Current nursing home COVID-19 screening guidance includes assessment for fever defined as a temperature of at least 38.0°C. The objective of this study is to describe the temperature changes before and after universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nursing home residents. Design Cohort study Setting and Participants: The Veterans Administration (VA) operates 134 Community Living Centers (CLC), similar to nursing homes, that house residents who cannot live independently. VA guidance to CLCs directed daily clinical screening for COVID-19 that included temperature assessment. Measures All CLC residents (n=7325) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. We report the temperature in window of the 14 days before and after universal SARS-CoV-2 testing among CLC residents. Baseline temperature was calculated for 5 days prior to the study window. Results SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 443 (6.0%) residents. The average maximum temperature in SARS-CoV-2 positive residents was 37.66 (0.69) compared to 37.11 (0.36) (p=0.001) in SARS-CoV-2 negative residents. Temperatures in those with SARS-CoV-2 began rising 7 days prior to testing and remained elevated during the 14-day follow up. Among SARS-CoV-2 positive residents, only 26.6% (n=118) met the fever threshold of 38.0°C during the survey period. Most residents (62.5%, n=277) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 did experience two or more 0.5°C elevations above their baseline values. One cohort of SARS-CoV-2 residents’ (20.3%, n=90) temperatures never deviated >0.5°C from baseline. Conclusions and Implications A single screening for temperature is unlikely to detect nursing home residents with SARS-CoV-2. Repeated temperature measurement with a patient-derived baseline can increase sensitivity. The current fever threshold as a screening criteria for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be reconsidered.\"\n",

      "\"Quantifying early COVID-19 outbreak transmission in South Africa and exploring vaccine efficacy scenariosBackground: COVID-19 has emerged and spread at great speed globally and has presented one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times with no proven cure or vac-cine. Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the spectrum of disease severity is not yet clear. Methods: We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverages to con-trol the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures imple-mented. Results: Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33). A vaccine with 70% effi-cacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination cover-age 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44-99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72-69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76-80.85%). Conclusions: Findings suggest a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to con-tain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics.\"\n",

Our main outcome measures include operative time, blood loss, conversion rate, transfusion rate, hospital length of stay, complications, readmission, and fistula healing rate. In our study, we found robotic resection for colonic diverticulitis with fistula was technically feasible and yielded 100% fistula healing rate. The operative time, complication and readmission rates were similar to laparoscopy. A higher conversion rate, diverting stoma need, and longer hospital length of stay were noted in the robotic group; however, these findings could have been attributed to a higher number of cases involving rectal excision in the robotic group.

      "\"Assay for screening for six antimalarial drugs and one metabolite using dried blood spot sampling, sequential extraction and ion-trap detectionBACKGROUND: More parasites are becoming resistant to antimalarial drugs, and in many areas a change in first-line drug treatment is necessary. The aim of the developed assay is to help determine drug use in these areas and also to be a complement to interviewing patients, which will increase reliability of surveys. RESULTS: This assay detects quinine, mefloquine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, lumefantrine, chloroquine and its metabolite desethylchloroquine in a 100-µl dried blood spot. Most of the drugs also have long half-lives that make them detectable at least 7 days after administration. The drugs are extracted from the dried blood spot with sequential extraction (due to the big differences in physicochemical properties), solid-phase extraction is used as sample clean-up and separation is performed with gradient-LC with MS ion-trap detection. CONCLUSION: Detection limits (S/N > 5:1) at 50 ng/ml or better were achieved for all drugs except lumefantrine (200 ng/ml), and thus can be used to determine patient compliance. A major advantage of using the ion-trap MS it that it will be possible to go back into the data and look for other drugs as needed.\"\n",

In humans, caliciviruses are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis, while in animals respiratory illness, conjunctivitis, stomatitis, and hemorrhagic disease are documented. Investigation of virus-host interactions is limited by a lack of culture systems for many viruses in this family. Feline calicivirus (FCV), a member of the Vesivirus genus, provides a tractable model, since it may be propagated in cell culture. Feline junctional adhesion molecule 1 (fJAM-1) was recently identified as a functional receptor for FCV. We have analyzed the structure of this virus-receptor complex by cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction, combined with fitting of homology modeled high-resolution coordinates. We show that domain 1 of fJAM-1 binds to the outer face of the P2 domain of the FCV capsid protein VP1, inducing conformational changes in the viral capsid. This study provides the first structural view of a native calicivirus-protein receptor complex and insights into the mechanisms of virus attachment and uncoating.\"\n",

      "\"Modulation of coronavirus‐mediated cell fusion by homeostatic control of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolismCellular susceptibility to fusion mediated by murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus, MHV strain A59) was separated into lipid‐dependent and lipid‐independent mechanisms with the use of subclones and selected mutants of mouse L‐2 fibroblasts. Fusion‐resistant L‐2 cell mutants had similar cholesterol and fatty acid composition as did their fusion‐susceptible parent subclone, and were presumably deficient in a genetically mutable non‐lipid, host cell factor (e.g., fusion protein receptor). On the other hand, cellular sensitivity to virus fusion, which is known to be influenced by cell cholesterol content [Daya et al., 1988], was shown further to be modulated by homeostatic alterations in fatty acid metabolism. Cholesterol supplementation of mouse L‐2 fibroblasts or of peritoneal macrophages from MHV‐susceptible mice elevated susceptibility to viral fusion. Increased fusion susceptibility occurred in cholesterol‐supplemented L‐2 cells in the absence of any detectable alterations i n host cell fatty acid composition, thus demonstrating fusion enhancement by cholesterol alone. L‐2 cells cloned by limiting dilution in normal (not cholesterol‐supplemented) medium were found to be heterogeneous i n cholesterol content. Interestingly, high cholesterol‐containing subclones had increased levels of C‐18:0, C‐18:2, C‐20:4, and C‐22:6 and markedly reduced levels of C‐18:l fatty acids when compared to low cholesterol‐containing subclones. High cholesterol‐containing subclones did not show enhanced susceptibility to viral fusion, suggesting that homeostatic alteration of fatty acid metabolism compensated for the increased cholesterol levels and countered the normally fusion‐enhancing effect of cholesterol alone. Since these observations have potentially important consequences regarding the effects of dietary cholesterol on the severity of virus infection, we examined liver titres and pathology of normal and hypercholesterolemic mice infected with MHV. Hypercholesterolemia had no significant effect on virus replication or on liver pathology in two MHV‐ sensitive strains (Balb/c and AIJ) or in one MHV‐resistant (SJLIJ) of mice. Lipid analyses of the livers from normal and hypercholesterolemic mice showed evidence of two homeostatic mechanisms (cholesterol esterification and alteration of fatty acid composition) which likely counteracted the normally exacerbating effect of cholesterol on MHV cytopathology.\"\n",

      "\"Delivering Benefits at Speed Through Real-World Repurposing of Off-Patent Drugs: The COVID-19 Pandemic as a Case in PointReal-world drug repurposing—the immediate “off-label” prescribing of drugs to address urgent clinical needs—is a widely overlooked opportunity. Off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries and tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, health crises may mean that real-world repurposing is the only realistic source for solutions. Optimal real-world repurposing requires a track record of safety, affordability, and access for drug candidates. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, there is no central repository of off-label uses to facilitate immediate identification and selection of potentially useful interventions during public health crises. Using the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse of the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and targeted toward the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so deadly. This paper briefly summarizes why cimetidine or famotidine, dipyridamole, fenofibrate or bezafibrate, and sildenafil citrate are worth considering for patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course. These examples also reveal the unlimited opportunity to future-proof our health care systems by proactively mining, synthesizing, cataloging, and evaluating the off-label treatment opportunities of thousands of safe, well-established, and affordable generic drugs.\"\n",

      "\"Influenza A Virus M2 Protein Apical Targeting Is Required for Efficient Virus Replication.The influenza A virus (IAV) M2 protein is a multifunctional protein with critical roles in virion entry, assembly, and budding. M2 is targeted to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells, and the interaction of the viral proteins M2, M1, HA, and NA near glycolipid rafts in the apical plasma membrane is hypothesized to coordinate the assembly of infectious virus particles. To determine the role of M2 protein apical targeting in IAV replication, a panel of M2 proteins with basolateral plasma membrane (M2-Baso) or endoplasmic reticulum (M2-ER) targeting sequences was generated. MDCK II cells stably expressing M2-Baso, but not M2-ER, complemented the replication of M2-stop viruses. However, in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, viruses encoding M2-Baso and M2-ER replicated to negligible titers compared to those of wild-type virus. M2-Baso replication was negatively correlated with cell polarization. These results demonstrate that M2 apical targeting is essential for IAV replication: targeting M2 to the ER results in a strong, cell type-independent inhibition of virus replication, and targeting M2 to the basolateral membrane has greater effects in hNECs than in MDCK cells.IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus assembly and particle release occur at the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells. The integral membrane proteins encoded by the virus, HA, NA, and M2, are all targeted to the apical membrane and believed to recruit the other structural proteins to sites of virus assembly. By targeting M2 to the basolateral or endoplasmic reticulum membranes, influenza A virus replication was significantly reduced. Basolateral targeting of M2 reduced the infectious virus titers with minimal effects on virus particle release, while targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum resulted in reduced infectious and total virus particle release. Therefore, altering the expression and the intracellular targeting of M2 has major effects on virus replication.\"\n",

      "\"Does the cost of robotic cholecystectomy translate to a financial burden?INTRODUCTION Robotic application to cholecystectomy has dramatically increased, though its impact on cost of care and reimbursement has not been elucidated. We undertook this study to evaluate and compare cost of care and reimbursement with robotic versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS AND PROCEDURES The charges and reimbursement of all robotic and laparoscopic cholecystectomies at one hospital undertaken from June 2012 to June 2013 were determined. Operative duration is defined as time into and time out of the operating room. Data are presented as median data. Comparisons were undertaken using the Mann-Whitney U-test with significance accepted at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS Robotic cholecystectomy took longer (47 min longer) and had greater charges ($8,182.57 greater) than laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p < 0.05 for each). However, revenue, earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes (EBDIT), and Net Income were not impacted by approach. CONCLUSIONS Relative to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, robotic cholecystectomy takes longer and has greater charges. Revenue, EBDIT, and Net Income are similar after either approach; this indicates that costs with either approach are similar. Notably, this is possible because much of hospital-based costs are determined by cost allocation and not cost accounting. Thus, the cost of longer operations and costs inherent to the robotic approach for cholecystectomy do not translate to a perceived financial burden.\"\n",

Our study showed that codon usage bias of DEV UL21 had strong bias towards the A-ended or T-ended codons, and GC3s contents of the codon usage bias in DEV UL21 gene were significantly varied compared with those of other 27 reference herpesviruses. The CAI, ENC value of DEV CHv strain UL21 gene is 0.615 and 55.167, respectively, indicating that the codon usage bias of this gene is weak and lowly expressed. The plot of ENC versus GC3S content revealed that DEV UL21 gene is subject to GC compositional constraints. The phylogentic analysis about amino acids codon usage bias of DEV UL21 and the27 reference herpesviruses showed that DEV was evolutionarily closer to herpesviruses Mardivirus. In addition, the codon usage bias of DEV UL21 gene was compared with those of E. coli, yeast and humans. There are 42, 45, 39 same codons usage bias between the DEV UL21 to E.coli, Yeast, H.sapiens, respectively, indicaiting that UL21 gene of DEV may be more efficiently expressed in the yeast system.\"\n",

Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries. This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed. Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.\"\n",

      "\"Lectin Switching During Dengue Virus InfectionDengue virus receptors are relatively poorly characterized, but there has been recent interest in 2 C-type lectin molecules, dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3)–grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and its close homologue liver/lymph node–specific ICAM-3–grabbing integrin (L-SIGN), which can both bind dengue and promote infection. In this report we have studied the interaction of dengue viruses produced in insect cells, tumor cell lines, and primary human dendritic cells (DCs) with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. Virus produced in primary DCs is unable to interact with DC-SIGN but remains infectious for L-SIGN–expressing cells. Skin-resident DCs may thus be a site of initial infection by insect-produced virus, but DCs will likely not participate in large-scale virus replication during dengue infection. These results reveal that differential glycosylation of dengue virus envelope protein is highly dependent on cell state and suggest that studies of virus tropism using virus prepared in insect cells or tumor cell lines should be interpreted with caution.\"\n",

      "\"RNA interference-mediated virus clearance from cells both acutely and chronically infected with the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.Several arenaviruses, including Lassa fever virus, cause severe, often lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. No licensed vaccines are available in the United States, and currently there is no efficacious therapy to treat this viral infection. Therefore the importance of developing effective antiviral approaches to combat pathogenic arenaviruses is clear. Moreover, the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an important model for the study of viral persistence and associated diseases, as well as for exploring therapies to treat viral chronic infections. The use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to downregulate gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a powerful genetic tool for the study of gene function. In addition, the successful use of siRNAs to target a variety of animal viruses has led us to consider RNAi as a potential novel antiviral strategy. We have investigated the use of RNAi therapy against LCMV. Here, we show that siRNAs targeting sequences within the viral L polymerase and Z mRNAs inhibit LCMV multiplication in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, the antiviral efficacy of RNAi-based therapy against LCMV was highly dependent on the method used to deliver effector siRNA molecules. Thus, transfection of chemically synthesized siRNA pools to L and Z was ineffective in preventing virus multiplication. In contrast, targeting of the same viral L and Z gene products with siRNAs produced inside cells using a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system inhibited LCMV multiplication very efficiently. Notably, transduction with the replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus expression system to Z and L effectively cured persistently LCMV-infected cells, suggesting the feasibility of using RNAi therapy to combat viral chronic infections by riboviruses.\"\n",

Twenty unvaccinated pregnant sows were equally allocated to probiotic‐supplemented (P) and control (C) groups. For the experiment, 15 g/day of probiotic compound BIO‐THREE PZ was given to P sows. Reproductive performance was checked daily. The number of neonates fostered by each sow was maintained at eight throughout the experiment. Individual milk production post‐parturition was measured twice. Milk protein and fat ratios were determined by a milk analyzer. Total immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G concentrations were measured by ELISA. At day 7 post‐parturition, the body weight of P sows was 10 kg higher than that of C sows, and at day 3 post‐parturition, P sows produced more milk (+2 kg) and had a higher IgA concentration in whey than did C sows (p < .05). Finally, unlike C sows, P sows tended to return to estrus faster, and had larger piglets at birth with a lower mortality percentage during early days of suckling. In conclusion, probiotic compound BIO‐THREE PZ helped strengthen the immune system of unvaccinated, PED‐infected sows and improved their reproductive performance.\"\n",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, blinded, randomized experimental study in two centres. ANIMALS Eighty-three healthy New Zealand White rabbits undergoing tibial or ulnar osteotomy. METHODS Medetomidine (0.2 mg kg-1) with 10 mg kg-1 ketamine (MK) or 5 mg kg-1 S(+)-ketamine (MS) was administered IN to each rabbit in a randomized fashion. In Centre 1 (n = 42) rabbits were held in sternal recumbency, and in Centre 2 (n = 41) in dorsal recumbency, during drug instillation. Adverse reactions were recorded. If a rabbit swallowed during endotracheal intubation, half of the initial IN dose was repeated and intubation was re-attempted after 5 minutes. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. Heart rate, blood pressure, endtidal carbon dioxide concentration and blood gases were recorded. Data were analysed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS In all, 39 animals were assigned to the MK group and 44 to the MS group. Two rabbits in the MS group held in dorsal recumbency died after instillation of the drug. Eight (MK) and 11 rabbits (MS) were insufficiently anaesthetized and received a second IN dose. One rabbit in MK and three in MS required an isoflurane mask induction after the second IN dose. There were no significant differences between treatments for induction, intraoperative data, blood gas values and recovery data. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study indicated that medetomidine-ketamine and medetomidine-S(+)-ketamine were effective shortly after IN delivery, but in dorsal recumbency IN administration of S(+)-ketamine led to two fatalities. Nasal haemorrhage was noted in both cases; however, the factors leading to death have not been fully elucidated.\"\n",

Methods The data on confirmed COVID-2019 cases were collected between January 20, 2020 and February 18, 2020 and by age, sex, nationality, contact history, region, and country were performed stratified analysis and onset time analysis. Results From January 20th to February 18th, the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVI D-2019 abroad was 804. Excluding the 454 cases on the 'Diamond Princess' cruise ship in Japan, the daily number of new cases fluctuated, showed a trend of rising first and then maintaining a steady trend. The peak date for new cases was on February 1, with the number of cases reaching 26. The confirmed cases were mainly concentrated in Asian countries, but also distributed in Europe, North America, Oceania and Africa. As of February 15, there was no more increase reported in the number of countries where confirmed cases occurred after reaching 25. Among these countries, Singapore, Japan, and Thailand were with the highest number of cases, with 77, 65, and 35 cases, respectively. In accordamce to available information on confirmed cases, the cases with history of exposure to confirmed cases were more than those with history of living or traveling in Hubei. And more cases were non-Chinese nationalities, 40 years old and above, and males . Conclusion The novel coronavirus has transmitted abroad, and produced second-generation cases. Although the incidence is low abroad , its trend fluctuates greatly, so sufficient attention must be paid to the possibility of further transmission.\"\n",

      "\"ISG15 and immune diseasesAbstract ISG15, the product of interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15, is the first identified ubiquitin-like protein, consisting of two ubiquitin-like domains. ISG15 is synthesized as a precursor in certain mammals and, therefore, needs to be processed to expose the C-terminal glycine residue before conjugation to target proteins. A set of three-step cascade enzymes, an E1 enzyme (UBE1L), an E2 enzyme (UbcH8), and one of several E3 ligases (e.g., EFP and HERC5), catalyzes ISG15 conjugation (ISGylation) of a specific protein. These enzymes are unique among the cascade enzymes for ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like proteins in that all of them are induced by type I IFNs or other stimuli, such as exposure to viruses and lipopolysaccharide. Mass spectrometric analysis has led to the identification of several hundreds of candidate proteins that can be conjugated by ISG15. Some of them are type I IFN-induced proteins, such as PKR and RIG-I, and some are the key regulators that are involved in IFN signaling, such as JAK1 and STAT1, implicating the role of ISG15 and its conjugates in type I IFN-mediated innate immune responses. However, relatively little is known about the functional significance of ISG15 induction due to the lack of information on the consequences of its conjugation to target proteins. Here, we describe the recent progress made in exploring the biological function of ISG15 and its reversible modification of target proteins and thus in their implication in immune diseases.\"\n",

      "\"Expressiveness and Conciseness of Timed Automata for the Verification of Stochastic ModelsTimed Automata are a well-known formalism for specifying timed behaviours. In this paper we are concerned with Timed Automata for the specification of timed behaviour of Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC), as used in the stochastic temporal logic CSL[Formula: see text]. A timed path formula of CSL[Formula: see text] is specified by a Deterministic Timed Automaton (DTA) that features two kinds of transitions: synchronizing transitions (triggered by CTMC transitions) and autonomous transitions (triggered when a clock reaches a given threshold). Other definitions of CSL[Formula: see text] are based on DTAs that do not include autonomous transitions. This raises the natural question: do autonomous transitions enhance expressiveness and/or conciseness of DTAs? We prove that this is the case and we provide a syntactical characterization of DTAs for which autonomous transitions do not add expressive power, but allow one to define exponentially more concise DTAs.\"\n",

This study evaluates the association between antihypertensive adherence and cardiovascular (coronary heart disease and stroke) mortality in the primary care settings. Methods From a territory-wide database in Hong Kong, we included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents in the years between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and assigned as having poor (Proportion of Days Covered [PDC]<40%), intermediate (40–79%), and high (≥80%) adherence to antihypertensive agents. The association between antihypertensive adherence and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated by using the Cox proportional hazard models. Results From a total of 218,047 eligible patients, 3825 patients (1.75%) died of cardiovascular disease within five years after having received their first-ever antihypertensive agents. The proportions of patients having poor, intermediate, and high medication adherence were 32.9%, 12.1%, and 55.0%, respectively. Higher adherence levels at PDC 40%–79% (HR=0.46, 95% C.I. 0.41–0.52, p<0.001) and ≥80% (HR=0.91, 95% C.I. 0.85–0.98, p=0.012) were significantly less likely to be associated with mortality than the poor adherence (PDC0.040) group. Conclusions Better antihypertensive adherence was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. This highlights the need to promote adherence through strategies which have been proved to be effective in clinical settings.\"\n",

Two key aspects of this interface to be discussed are the encoding of the algebraic hierarchy as a class hierarchy and a mechanism to support the combination of algebraic types as a new type. Existing libraries, if encoding the algebraic hierarchy at all, use runtime value checks to determine if two elements belong to the same ring for an incorrect false sense of type safety in an otherwise statically-typed language. On the contrary, our template metaprogramming mechanism provides true compile-time type safety and compile-time code generation. The details of this mechanism are transparent to end-users, providing a very natural interface for an end-user mathematician.\"\n",

Pseudoknot is one type of RNA structures that cannot be modeled with Context Free Grammars (CFG) because it exhibits crossing dependencies. Pseudoknot structures have functional importance since they appear, for example, in viral genome RNAs and ribozyme active sites. Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) is one example of a grammatical model that is more expressive than CFG and has the capability of dealing with crossing dependencies. In this paper, we describe a new inference algorithm for TAG(RNA,) a sub-model of TAG.

      "\"EMIXER: End-to-end Multimodal X-ray Generation via Self-supervisionDeep generative models have enabled the automated synthesis of high-quality data for diverse applications. However, the most effective generative models are specialized to data from a single domain (e.g., images or text). Real-world applications such as healthcare require multi-modal data from multiple domains (e.g., both images and corresponding text), which are difficult to acquire due to limited availability and privacy concerns and are much harder to synthesize. To tackle this joint synthesis challenge, we propose an End-to-end MultImodal X-ray genERative model (EMIXER) for jointly synthesizing x-ray images and corresponding free-text reports, all conditional on diagnosis labels. EMIXER is an conditional generative adversarial model by 1) generating an image based on a label, 2) encoding the image to a hidden embedding, 3) producing the corresponding text via a hierarchical decoder from the image embedding, and 4) a joint discriminator for assessing both the image and the corresponding text. EMIXER also enables self-supervision to leverage vast amount of unlabeled data. Extensive experiments with real X-ray reports data illustrate how data augmentation using synthesized multimodal samples can improve the performance of a variety of supervised tasks including COVID-19 X-ray classification with very limited samples. The quality of generated images and reports are also confirmed by radiologists. We quantitatively show that EMIXER generated synthetic datasets can augment X-ray image classification, report generation models to achieve 5.94% and 6.9% improvement on models trained only on real data samples. Taken together, our results highlight the promise of state of generative models to advance clinical machine learning.\"\n",

There is not any standard treatment for coronavirus infection 2019; however, there are promising data for hydroxychloroquine and some anti-retroviral drugs. Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) pathway is an important target for the cancer immunotherapy. However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections. Thus, blockade of this pathway may lead to an anti-viral effect and decrease viral load.

      "\"Pneumonies communautaires graves de l'adulteRésumé Les pneumonies aiguës communautaires sont des causes fréquentes d'hospitalisation et de mortalité. La reconnaissance immédiate des formes sévères sur des critères simples, cliniques, radiologiques et biologiques, est une étape importante pour une prise en charge rapide en réanimation afin de contrôler les défaillances d'organes. Les prélèvements appropriés microbiologiques précèdent l'antibiothérapie qui doit être instituée très rapidement après le diagnostic de pneumonie. Malgré les techniques d'identification, la moitié seulement des pneumonies sont documentées. Cette antibiothérapie, initialement probabiliste, intègre les germes pathogènes les plus souvent responsables, extra- et intracellulaires ; elle doit toujours être active sur le pneumocoque, bactérie la plus fréquente. L'association d'une β-lactamine et d'un macrolide ou d'une fluoroquinolone répond le mieux à cet objectif. Les fluoroquinolones actives sur le pneumocoque se sont substituées aux précédentes dans les plus récentes recommandations. Dans le cas exceptionnel des patients ayant des facteurs de risque particuliers, le traitement probabiliste doit prendre en compte Pseudomonas aeruginosa. La gravité d'une partie des pneumonies communautaires justifie le recours à des traitements adjuvants. L'antibiothérapie doit être réévaluée dans les 72 heures dans le but d'apprécier son efficacité, de l'adapter éventuellement et de la simplifier. La poursuite des antibiotiques à large spectre expose le patient à des effets indésirables et contribue aux résistances bactériennes. Pour les pneumonies dues au pneumocoque, les fluoroquinolones actives sur le pneumocoque pourront constituer une alternative en cas d'évolution importante des résistances du pneumocoque aux β-lactamines. La mortalité persistante des pneumonies reste sévère. Ceci doit stimuler l'amélioration de la prise en charge initiale et faire rechercher de nouvelles thérapeutiques. Abstract Community-acquired pneumonias are major causes of hospitalization and death. Immediate assessment of severity, based on accurate clinical criteria, is an important step for rapid intensive care management and control of organ failures. Appropriate microbiological sampling should be performed prior to the antimicrobial therapy that should be initiated promptly after the diagnostic. Despite identification techniques, only 50% of community-acquired pneumonia cases are documented. Antibiotherapy is initially empirical. The goal is to provide optimal therapy for the most commonly identified causes of lethal pneumonia: extracellular and intracellular pathogens. A therapeutic regimen with a β-lactam combined with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone is recommended. This combination should be always active against pneumococci. Despite increased pneumococcal penicillin resistance, the recent recommendations are not modified. Respiratory fluoroquinolones may be an alternative in case of major increase of pneumococcal resistance to β-lactams. In some special populations, with regard to underlying structural disease of the lung and other risk factors, Pseudomonas aeruginosa must be taken into account. The severity of some community-acquired pneumonias necessitates the use of adjunctive treatments. Reassessment should be undertaken 72 hours after initiation of therapy in order to evaluate the response to treatment, to simplify or to readapt the empirical treatment. Unjustified continuation of wide spectrum antibiotics leads to adverse events and widespread of bacterial resistance. The poor outcome of severe pneumonias justifies research on initial process of care and new therapeutics.\"\n",

To investigate the clinical relevance of RSV-A ON1,acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases enrolled to our population-based prospective pediatric ARI surveillance at Khanh Hoa General Hospital, Central Vietnam from January 2010 through December 2012 were studied. Clinical-epidemiological information and nasopharyngeal samples were collected. Multiplex PCR assays were performed for screening 13 respiratory viruses. RSV-positive samples were further tested for subgroups (A/B) and genotypes information by sequencing the G-glycoprotein 2nd hypervariable region. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of RSV-A ON1. A total of 1854 ARI cases were enrolled and 426 (23.0%) of them were RSV-positive. During the study period, RSV-A and B had been co-circulating. NA1 was the predominant RSV-A genotype until the appearance of ON1 in 2012. RSV-related ARI hospitalization incidence significantly increased after the emergence of ON1. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that risk of lower respiratory tract infection was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.37–3.72) times, and radiologically-confirmed pneumonia was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.01–3.87) times greater in ON1 compared to NA1 cases.

      "\"Evaluation of the INCREMENT-CPE, Pitt Bacteremia and qPitt Scores in Patients with Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Infections Treated with Ceftazidime–AvibactamBACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive performance of the INCREMENT-CPE (ICS), Pitt bacteremia score (PBS) and qPitt for mortality among patients treated with ceftazidime–avibactam for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections. METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter, cohort study of patients with CRE infections treated with ceftazidime–avibactam between 2015 and 2019. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Predictive performance was determined by assessing discrimination, calibration and precision. RESULTS: In total, 109 patients were included. Thirty-day mortality occurred in 18 (16.5%) patients. There were no significant differences in discrimination of the three scores [area under the curve (AUC) ICS 0.7039, 95% CI 0.5848–0.8230, PBS 0.6893, 95% CI 0.5709–0.8076, and qPitt 0.6847, 95% CI 0.5671–0.8023; P > 0.05 all pairwise comparisons]. All scores showed adequate calibration and precision. When dichotomized at the optimal cut-points of 11, 3, and 2 for the ICS, PBS, and qPitt, respectively, all scores had NPV > 90% at the expense of low PPV. Patients in the high-risk groups had a relative risk for mortality of 3.184 (95% CI 1.35–8.930), 3.068 (95% CI 1.094–8.606), and 2.850 (95% CI 1.016–7.994) for the dichotomized ICS, PBS, and qPitt, scores respectively. Treatment-related variables (early active antibiotic therapy, combination antibiotics and renal ceftazidime–avibactam dose adjustment) were not associated with mortality after controlling for the risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: In patients treated with ceftazidime–avibactam for CRE infections, mortality risk scores demonstrated variable performance. Modifications to scoring systems to more accurately predict outcomes in the era of novel antibiotics are warranted.

      "\"Chapter 4 Molecular Modeling of Major Structural Protein Genes of Avian Coronavirus: Infectious Bronchitis Virus Mass H120 and Italy02 StrainsAbstract In Morocco, the epidemiological situation of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is very complex, because of the antigenic diversity associated with the emergence of new serotypes/genotypes and variants. The IBV strains circulating in poultry farms are serotypes/genotypes Italy02 and Massachusetts (Mass) identified during 2010–14. The appearance of these variants hinders the prophylactic strategy carried out by the breeders of the Moroccan poultry farm. To solve this problem, we have opted for the rational design of candidate vaccines in order to study the structure of the three-dimensional (3D) S1 spicule protein of serotype Italy02 and Mass H120, through molecular modeling, using the I-TASSER server, then the COACH, and another Meta server to determine and predict the common immunogenic active sites between these two IBV strains circulating in Morocco. The obtained results showed that the two strains studied had identical spatial conformation of the S1 protein structure with a similarity percentage of 81% and an average stability of the modeled sequences. Thus both serotypes share active antigenic sites common in the hypervariable region, located at residues 229, 230, 232, 233, and 235, with a magnesium molecule association around the Alanine 280 region responsible for stimulating immunogenicity. The quality of the 3D conformation, the stability, and the percentage make it possible to have accessibility to the common predicted neutralizing epitopes. Based on these data, we can conclude that it is highly probable that the H120 vaccine strain confers cross-protection against a challenge with new strains Italy02 circulating in Morocco.\"\n",

      "\"Technical aspects and outcome of a standardized full laparoscopic approach to the reversal of Hartmann's procedure in a teaching centre.AIM Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure is technically demanding. We evaluated the technical aspects and outcome of a standardized approach in a single centre and examined the feasibility of including this into training curricula. METHOD The procedure entails a laparoscopy for adhesiolysis and identification and mobilization of the rectal stump. Mobilization of the splenic flexure is performed if necessary, and a colorectal anastomosis is fashioned after introduction of the stapler anvil via the colostomy with intra-abdominal positioning and delivery into the proximal colonic segment to be anastomosed. The stoma is excised as the last step in the operation. RESULTS Forty-two patients underwent the procedure over an 8-year period with either an expert (n=21) or trainee under expert mentorship (n=21) as first operator. Intra-operative data and postoperative outcomes were evaluated by retrospective review of clinical charts and theatre records. There was a 9.5% conversion rate and 0% mortality. One patient suffered a ureteric injury, while postoperative surgical complications occurred in 7 patients (including one clinical anastomotic leakage). The mean operative time was 117 min. There was no significant difference in intra operative technical parameters or postoperative clinical consequences between procedures performed by a trained surgeon or by a trainee under mentorship. CONCLUSION Adherence to a standardized operative protocol and expert mentorship allows this technically demanding operation to be associated with low conversion and complication rates. The absence of any difference between procedures performed by a trainee or trained surgeon suggests that the operation can be included in training programmes for laparoscopic surgery.\"\n",

      "\"Learning hidden influences in large-scale dynamical social networks: A data-driven sparsity-based approachInterpersonal influence estimation from empirical data is a central challenge in the study of social structures and dynamics. Opinion dynamics theory is a young interdisciplinary science that studies opinion formation in social networks and has a huge potential in applications, such as marketing, advertisement and recommendations. The term social influence refers to the behavioral change of individuals due to the interactions with others in a social system, e.g. organization, community, or society in general. The advent of the Internet has made a huge volume of data easily available that can be used to measure social influence over large populations. Here, we aim at qualitatively and quantitatively infer social influence from data using a systems and control viewpoint. First, we introduce some definitions and models of opinions dynamics and review some structural constraints of online social networks, based on the notion of sparsity. Then, we review the main approaches to infer the network's structure from a set of observed data. Finally, we present some algorithms that exploit the introduced models and structural constraints, focusing on the sample complexity and computational requirements.\"\n",

      "\"Coronavirus and sports leagues: how to obtain a fair ranking if the season cannot resume?Many sports leagues are played in a tightly scheduled round-robin format, leaving a limited time window to postpone matches. If the season cannot resume due to an external shock such as the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, the ranking of the teams becomes non-trivial because it is necessary to account for schedule imbalances. We identify a set of desired axioms for ranking in such incomplete tournaments and verify that the generalized row sum, a parametric family of scoring rules, satisfies all of them. In particular, the well-established least squares method maximizes the role of the opponents. Our approach is applied for the five major premier European soccer competitions, where the rankings are found to be robust concerning the weight of adjustment for the opponents. Since disregarding the majority of the matches without promotion, relegation, and qualification for international cups would be unfair and unjustified, some simpler alternative policies are also discussed.\"\n",

Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) is part of the continuum of pneumonia, which includes patients who were hospitalized in an acute-care hospital for ≥2 days within 90 days of the infection; resided in a long-term care facility; received recent intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care within the past 30 days of the current infection; or attended a hospital or hemodialysis clinic.(1,2) Although this document focuses more on HAP and VAP, many of the principles are also relevant to the management of HCAP.

Esse gene já foi relatado em muitas espécies de bactérias, inclusive no gênero Aeromonas. Essas bactérias causam alta mortalidade na piscicultura trazendo prejuízos econômicos. É importante que haja estudos sobre esse gene e possíveis mutações que possam levar a alterações na estrutura e função da proteína. Os objetivos desse estudo foram caracterizar o gene floR em isolados de Aeromonas spp. obtidas do Vale do São Francisco e verificar se a presença desse gene está associada com a resistência ao florfenicol. Foram realizadas reações em cadeia da polimerase (PCR) para a presença do gene floR em 27 isolados de Aeromonas spp.. Amostras positivas para a presença do gene foram sequenciadas e analisadas quanto à presença de polimorfismos por meio de alinhamentos. Os diferentes haplótipos detectados foram utilizados para análises com os programas SIFT e PolyPhen para predição de alteração de função proteica. A modelagem estrutural da proteina codificada pelo gene floR foi realizada com o programa Modeller e, os modelos foram avaliados pelo Procheck, Verify3D e Whatif. A similaridade da estrutura tridimensional da proteína referência com as estruturas tridimensionais das proteínas codificadas pelos diferentes haplótipos foi comparada através do TM-align. A resistência das bactérias ao florfenicol foi avaliada através do teste de microdiluição em caldo, o qual também foi realizado na presença do carbonil cianeto m-clorofenil hidrazona para verificar o efeito da inibição da bomba de efluxo sobre tal resistência. Dos vinte e sete isolados avaliados quanto a presença do gene floR, 14 isolados foram positivos e 10 foram sequenciados, o que permitiu a identificação de três polimorfismos no gene floR, que levaram a construção de três haplótipos diferentes (TAA, TTA e CTG)...(AU)\"\n",

Both zoonoses share nonspecific early symptoms, a high lethality rate, and a reduced number of specific treatment options. Therefore, we evaluated extracorporeal virus and glycoprotein (GP) elimination by lectin affinity plasmapheresis (LAP). METHODS For both MERS-CoV (pseudovirus) as well as MARV (GPs), 4 LAP devices (Mini Hemopurifiers, Aethlon Medical, San Diego, CA, USA) and 4 negative controls were tested. Samples were collected every 30 min and analyzed for reduction in virus infectivity by a flow cytometry-based infectivity assay (MERS-CoV) and in soluble GP content (MARV) by an immunoassay. RESULTS The experiments show a time-dependent clearance of MERS-CoV of up to 80% within 3 h (pseudovirus). Up to 70% of MARV-soluble GPs were eliminated at the same time. Substantial saturation of the binding resins was detected within the first treatment hour. CONCLUSION MERS-CoV (pseudovirus) and MARV soluble GPs are eliminated by LAP in vitro. Considering the high lethality and missing established treatment options, LAP should be evaluated in vivo. Especially early initiation, continuous therapy, and timed cartridge exchanges could be of importance.\"\n",

In general, enteric viruses (TGEV) have been shown to contain intact spike and ORF 3 genes, whilst respiratory isolates (PRCV) have major deletions within both regions. Virulence has been correlated to a functional ORF 3. Here, sequence analysis of a recent isolate of virulent TGEV, revealed a variant with an intact spike gene, but a large deletion in ORF 3a. This suggests that ORF 3a is not essential for enteric virulence.\"\n",

      "\"Critical Care And Emergency Department Response At The Epicenter Of The COVID-19 PandemicNew York City (NYC) has emerged as the global epicenter for the COVID-19 pandemic. The NYC Public Health System (NYC Health +Hospitals, NYC H + H) was key to the city's response because its vulnerable patient population was disproportionately affected by the disease. As cases rose in the city, NYC H+H carried out plans to greatly expand critical care capacity. Primary ICU spaces were identified and upgraded as needed, while new ICU spaces were created in emergency departments (EDs), procedural areas, and other inpatient units. Patients were transferred between hospitals in order to reduce strain. Critical care staffing was supplemented by temporary recruits, volunteers, and military deployments. Supplies to deliver critical care were monitored closely and obtained as needed to prevent interruptions. An ED action team was formed to ensure that the experience of frontline providers was informing network level decisions. The steps taken by NYC H+H greatly expanded its capacity to provide critical care during an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases in NYC. These steps, along with lessons learned, could inform preparations for other health systems during a primary or secondary surge of cases.

      "\"Simultaneous quantification of cyclosporin A and its major metabolites by time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectrometry and matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry utilizing data analysis techniques: Comparison with high‐performance liquid chromatographySimultaneous quantification of cyclosporin A (CsA) and its major metabolite (AM1) in blood has been achieved using time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectrometry (TOF‐SIMS) and matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF‐MS). Previous investigations indicated that spectral interferences exist in the analysis of CsA blood samples by the above methods. In TOF‐SIMS, interference is caused by overlap of the Ag‐cationized internal standard, cyclosporin D (CsD), with the Ag‐cationized metabolite, AM1. To resolve this interference and obtain quantitative information, cross‐correlation analysis was applied to the TOF‐SIMS data. Application of damped non‐linear least squares curve‐fitting was carried out to resolve an interference in the MALDI/TOF‐MS data due to multiple cationization products (i.e. Na and K). Measurement of standard samples indicates that the minimum accuracy (95% confidence level) of the TOF‐SIMS method was better than 9% for CsA and 13% for AM1 using only one standard curve'. Similarly, the minimum accuracy of the MALDI/TOF‐MS method was determined to be 14% for CsA and better than 25% for AM1. Blood samples obtained from transplant patients receiving CsA were analyzed by polyclonal fluorescence polarization immunoassay, high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and by both TOF‐MS methods. Both TOF‐MS results for CsA and mono‐hydroxylated CsA are in good agreement with the HPLC results.\"\n",

      "\"Avian Influenza: a global threat needing a global solutionThere have been three influenza pandemics since the 1900s, of which the 1919–1919 flu pandemic had the highest mortality rates. The influenza virus infects both humans and birds, and mutates using two mechanisms: antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Currently, the H5N1 avian flu virus is limited to outbreaks among poultry and persons in direct contact to infected poultry, but the mortality rate among infected humans is high. Avian influenza (AI) is endemic in Asia as a result of unregulated poultry rearing in rural areas. Such birds often live in close proximity to humans and this increases the chance of genetic re-assortment between avian and human influenza viruses which may produce a mutant strain that is easily transmitted between humans. Once this happens, a global pandemic is likely. Unlike SARS, a person with influenza infection is contagious before the onset of case-defining symptoms which limits the effectiveness of case isolation as a control strategy. Researchers have shown that carefully orchestrated of public health measures could potentially limit the spread of an AI pandemic if implemented soon after the first cases appear. To successfully contain and control an AI pandemic, both national and global strategies are needed. National strategies include source surveillance and control, adequate stockpiles of anti-viral agents, timely production of flu vaccines and healthcare system readiness. Global strategies such as early integrated response, curbing the disease outbreak at source, utilization of global resources, continuing research and open communication are also critical.\"\n",

      "\"Photochemical treatment of plasma with amotosalen and long‐wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates pathogens while retaining coagulation functionBACKGROUND: The INTERCEPT Blood System, a photochemical treatment (PCT) process, has been developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet concen‐trates. These studies evaluated the efficacy of PCT to inactivate pathogens in plasma and the effect of PCT on plasma function. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Jumbo (600 mL) plasma units were inoculated with high titers of test pathogens and treated with 150 µmol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) long‐wavelength ultraviolet light. The viability of each pathogen before and after treatment was measured with biological assays. Plasma function was evaluated through measurement of coagulation factors and antithrombotic protein activities. RESULTS: The levels of inactivation expressed as log‐reduction were as follows: cell‐free human immunodeficiency virus‐1 (HIV‐1), greater than 6.8; cell‐associated HIV‐1, greater than 6.4; human T‐lymphotropic virus‐I (HTLV‐I), 4.5; HTLV‐II, greater than 5.7; hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus, greater than 4.5; duck HBV, 4.4 to 4.5; bovine viral diarrhea virus, 6.0; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 5.5; West Nile virus, 6.8; bluetongue virus, 5.1; human adenovirus 5, 6.8; Klebsiella pneumoniae, greater than 7.4; Staphylococcus epidermidis and Yersinia enterocolitica, greater than 7.3; Treponema pallidum, greater than 5.9; Borrelia burgdorferi, greater than 10.6; Plasmodium falciparum, 6.9; Trypanosoma cruzi, greater than 5.0; and Babesia microti, greater than 5.3. Retention of coagulation factor activity after PCT was expressed as the proportion of pretreatment (baseline) activity. Retention was 72 to 73 percent of baseline fibrinogen and Factor (F)VIII activity and 78 to 98 percent for FII, FV, FVII, F IX, FX, FXI, FXIII, protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and α2‐antiplasmin. CONCLUSION: PCT of plasma inactivated high levels of a wide range of pathogens while maintaining adequate coagulation function. PCT has the potential to reduce the risk of transfusion‐transmitted diseases in patients requiring plasma transfusion support.\"\n",

      "\"The prevalence of Cryptosporidium/Giardia in the trail horse population utilizing public lands in ColoradoSummary Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. are small coccidian parasites that infect the intestinal tract of birds, reptiles and mammals including humans. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum and cysts of Giardia duodenalis are shed in the feces of infected animals and directly infect subsequent hosts following ingestion. The broad host range, resistant nature, and small size of the parasites in the environment may potentially contribute to contamination of water supplies. The perception that recreational riding horses may increase the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in large watersheds adjacent to common trails, indirectly infecting humans, has resulted in banning recreational riding horses from some trails. However, there is currently no scientific data linking the recreational trail horse to the incidence or increased risk of human cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis. This survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. in recreational horses utilizing trails located near large watershed areas in Colorado. At the trail heads, approximately 10 g of fresh feces were collected from recreational horses (n=300) that were utilizing the trails on the day they were sampled. Fecal samples were mixed with 10% formalin at a dilution rate of 1 part feces to 4 parts formalin and were transported to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Colorado State University. Samples were evaluated using the Merifluor™ Cryptosporidium/Giardia Direct Immunofluorescent Detection Procedure. One horse (0.33%) was detected positive for Cryptosporidium and two horses (0.66%) were positive for Giardia. The low prevalence of Cryptosporidia and Giardia in the trial horse population surveyed indicates that the adult recreational trail horse population is not likely to be a significant source of Cryptosporidium and Giardia environmental contamination in watershed areas.\"\n",

They are frequently seen in crowded inner cities as well as in forests or wooded areas, often living in proximity to humans and their pets. We examined sera from 100 wild raccoons in Japan for antibodies to six canine viruses with veterinary significance to assess their potential as reservoirs. We also aimed to understand the distribution of potentially infected wildlife. We found that 7% of samples were seropositive for canine distemper virus (CDV), 10% for canine parvovirus type 2, 2% for canine adenovirus type 1, 6% for canine adenovirus type 2, and 7% for canine coronavirus. No samples were found to be seropositive for canine parainfluenza virus. Seropositivity rates for canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus type 2 were significantly different between areas, and younger raccoons (<1 yr old) were more frequently seropositive than older raccoons. Because raccoons belong to the suborder Caniformia, similar to dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), our results suggest that they can act as reservoirs for some of these important canine viruses and might be involved in viral transmission. Further study should include isolation and analysis of canine viruses in wild raccoons from a wider area.\"\n",

      "\"Cohort Study of the Impact of High-Dose Opioid Analgesics on Overdose Mortality.OBJECTIVE Previous studies examining opioid dose and overdose risk provide limited granularity by milligram strength and instead rely on thresholds. We quantify dose-dependent overdose mortality over a large spectrum of clinically common doses. We also examine the contributions of benzodiazepines and extended release opioid formulations to mortality. DESIGN Prospective observational cohort with one year follow-up. SETTING One year in one state (NC) using a controlled substances prescription monitoring program, with name-linked mortality data. SUBJECTS Residential population of North Carolina (n = 9,560,234), with 2,182,374 opioid analgesic patients. METHODS Exposure was dispensed prescriptions of solid oral and transdermal opioid analgesics; person-years calculated using intent-to-treat principles. Outcome was overdose deaths involving opioid analgesics in a primary or additive role. Poisson models were created, implemented using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Opioid analgesics were dispensed to 22.8% of residents. Among licensed clinicians, 89.6% prescribed opioid analgesics, and 40.0% prescribed ER formulations. There were 629 overdose deaths, half of which had an opioid analgesic prescription active on the day of death. Of 2,182,374 patients prescribed opioids, 478 overdose deaths were reported (0.022% per year). Mortality rates increased gradually across the range of average daily milligrams of morphine equivalents. 80.0% of opioid analgesic patients also received benzodiazepines. Rates of overdose death among those co-dispensed benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics were ten times higher (7.0 per 10,000 person-years, 95 percent CI: 6.3, 7.8) than opioid analgesics alone (0.7 per 10,000 person years, 95 percent CI: 0.6, 0.9). CONCLUSIONS Dose-dependent opioid overdose risk among patients increased gradually and did not show evidence of a distinct risk threshold. There is urgent need for guidance about combined classes of medicines to facilitate a better balance between pain relief and overdose risk.\"\n",

      "\"Acquired palatal groove and delayed oral feeding in preterm infants.BACKGROUND Acquired palatal groove has been reported in the 1970s and 1980s, but its current incidence in Japanese newborns is unclear. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of palatal groove in preterm infants and to evaluate whether this condition affects oral feeding ability. METHODS We conducted a prospective observational study among very low-birthweight infants born at Takatsuki General Hospital, Osaka, between March and October in 2010. The shape of the hard palate was classified into three types: normal, narrow high-arched palate, and palatal groove. RESULTS Among the 37 enrolled infants, 14 (38%) had palatal groove. In particular, among the 29 infants with birthweight <1000 g, palatal groove was observed in 48% of these patients, and only 10% were normal. Infants with palatal groove were ventilated for considerably more days with oral endotracheal tube than those without palate groove, even after adjustment for gestational age, birthweight, and duration of oral duodenal tube placement (OR, 1.11). Establishment of oral feeding and disappearance of choking on milk were considerably delayed in infants with palatal groove. Transient oral feeding difficulty requiring thickened-feed intervention was observed only in infants with palatal groove; on multi-regression analysis this difficulty seemed to be induced by the palatal groove. CONCLUSIONS Palatal groove formation induced by oral endotracheal intubation occurs with a high frequency in preterm infants, and this is likely to affect oral feeding ability.\"\n",

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done &#8804;1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. FINDINGS: 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. FUNDING: None.\"\n",

      "\"Murine Coronavirus Infection Activates the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor in an Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase-Independent Manner, Contributing to Cytokine Modulation and Proviral TCDD-Inducible-PARP ExpressionThe aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a cytoplasmic receptor/transcription factor that modulates several cellular and immunological processes following activation by pathogen-associated stimuli, though its role during virus infection is largely unknown. Here, we show that AhR is activated in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus (CoV), and contributes to the upregulation of downstream effector TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP) during infection. Knockdown of TiPARP reduced viral replication and increased interferon expression, suggesting that TiPARP functions in a proviral manner during MHV infection. We also show that MHV replication induced the expression of other genes known to be downstream of AhR in macrophages and dendritic cells and in livers of infected mice. Further, we found that chemically inhibiting or activating AhR reciprocally modulated the expression levels of cytokines induced by infection, specifically, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), consistent with a role for AhR activation in the host response to MHV infection. Furthermore, while indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) drives AhR activation in other settings, MHV infection induced equal expression of downstream genes in wild-type (WT) and IDO1(−/−) macrophages, suggesting an alternative pathway of AhR activation. In summary, we show that coronaviruses elicit AhR activation by an IDO1-independent pathway, contributing to upregulation of downstream effectors, including the proviral factor TiPARP, and to modulation of cytokine gene expression, and we identify a previously unappreciated role for AhR signaling in CoV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses with human and agricultural significance. Characterizing the mechanisms by which coronavirus infection dictates pathogenesis or counters the host immune response would provide targets for the development of therapeutics. Here, we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is activated in cells infected with a prototypic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), resulting in the expression of several effector genes. AhR is important for modulation of the host immune response to MHV and plays a role in the expression of TiPARP, which we show is required for maximal viral replication. Taken together, our findings highlight a previously unidentified role for AhR in regulating coronavirus replication and the immune response to the virus.\"\n",

Viruses are frequently involved in asthma exacerbations. Objective To determine the value of measuring serum IgG concentrations in asthma exacerbations and assess their link with viral infections in patients hospitalized for asthma. Methods Patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation were included in an observational study from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015. Serum IgG concentrations on admission were compared between patients with a positive upper airway viral sample and those with a negative viral sample. Results Among the 82 patients included, those with positive viral nasopharyngeal samples (n = 40) presented with lower serum IgG concentrations during exacerbation than those with a negative viral sample (n = 42) (10.1 ± 2.3 g/L vs 11.5 ± 3.6 g/L; P < .05). The median concentration of serum IgG was lower in patients hospitalized for more than 3 days compared with those hospitalized for less than 3 days (10.0 g/L [8.2-12.4] vs 11.4 g/L [10.1-12.8]; P < .05) and in patients who received oral corticosteroid therapy for more than 5 days compared with those treated with oral steroids for less than 5 days (10.1 g/L [8.3-12.2] vs 11.6 g/L [10.0-13.8]; P < .05).

      "\"Review of Indoor Aerosol Generation, Transport and Control in the Context of COVID-19.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has heightened awareness of aerosol generation by human expiratory events and their potential role in viral respiratory disease transmission. Concerns over high Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral burden of mucosal surfaces has raised questions about the aerosol generating potential and dangers of many otorhinolaryngologic procedures. However, the risks of aerosol generation and associated viral transmission by droplet or airborne routes for many otorhinolaryngology procedures are largely unknown. Indoor aerosol and droplet viral respiratory transmission risk is influenced by four factors: 1) aerosol or droplet properties, 2) indoor airflow, 3) virus-specific factors, and 4) host-specific factors. Here we elaborate on known aerosol versus droplet properties, indoor airflow, and aerosol generating events to provide context for risks of aerosol infectious transmission. We also provide simple but typically effective measures for mitigating the spread and inhalation of viral aerosols in indoor settings. Understanding principles of infectious transmission, aerosol and droplet generation, as well as concepts of indoor airflow, will aide in the integration of new data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and activities that can generate aerosol to best inform on the need for escalation or de-escalation from current societal and institutional guidelines for protection during aerosol generating procedures.

      "\"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by inhalation of respiratory aerosol in the Skagit Valley Chorale superspreading eventDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak occurred following attendance of a symptomatic index case at a regular weekly rehearsal on 10 March of the Skagit Valley Chorale (SVC). After that rehearsal, 53 members of the SVC among 61 in attendance were confirmed or strongly suspected to have contracted COVID-19 and two died. Transmission by the airborne route is likely. It is vital to identify features of cases such as this so as to better understand the factors that promote superspreading events. Based on a conditional assumption that transmission during this outbreak was by inhalation of respiratory aerosol, we use the available evidence to infer the emission rate of airborne infectious quanta from the primary source. We also explore how the risk of infection would vary with several influential factors: the rates of removal of respiratory aerosol by ventilation; deposition onto surfaces; and viral decay. The results indicate an emission rate of the order of a thousand quanta per hour (mean [interquartile range] for this event = 970 [680-1190] quanta per hour) and demonstrate that the risk of infection is modulated by ventilation conditions, occupant density, and duration of shared presence with an infectious individual.\"\n",

Brain-derived cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins are potential biomarkers considering the major role that proteins play in PD pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the current hypotheses about the pathogenesis of PD and identify the most promising candidate biomarkers among the CSF proteins studied so far. The list of potential markers includes proteins involved in various pathogenetic processes, such as oxidative stress and protein aggregation. This list will undoubtedly grow in the near future by application of CSF proteomics and subsequent validation of identified proteins. Probably a single biomarker will not suffice to reach high sensitivity and specificity, because PD is pathogenetically heterogeneous and shares etiological factors with other neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, identified candidate biomarkers will have to be thoroughly validated before they can be implemented as diagnostic aids.\"\n",

We evaluated the prevalence of MERS coronavirus (CoV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G in HCWs exposed to MERS patients and calculated the incidence of MERS-affected cases in HCWs. We enrolled HCWs from hospitals where confirmed MERS patients had visited. Serum was collected 4 to 6 weeks after the last contact with a confirmed MERS patient. We performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen for the presence of MERS-CoV IgG and an indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) to confirm MERS-CoV IgG. We used a questionnaire to collect information regarding the exposure. We calculated the incidence of MERS-affected cases by dividing the sum of PCR-confirmed and serology-confirmed cases by the number of exposed HCWs in participating hospitals. In total, 1169 HCWs in 31 hospitals had contact with 114 MERS patients, and among the HCWs, 15 were PCR-confirmed MERS cases in study hospitals. Serologic analysis was performed for 737 participants. ELISA was positive in five participants and borderline for seven. IIFT was positive for two (0.3%) of these 12 participants. Among the participants who did not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), seropositivity was 0.7% (2/294) compared to 0% (0/443) in cases with appropriate PPE use.

      "\"The autodisplay story, from discovery to biotechnical and biomedical applications.Among the pathways used by gram-negative bacteria for protein secretion, the autotransporter pathway represents a solution of impressive simplicity. Proteins are transported, independent of their nature as recombinant or native passengers, as long as the coding nucleotide sequence is inserted in frame between those of an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal domain, referred to as the beta-barrel of the outer membrane translocation unit. The immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) protease from Neisseria gonorrhoeae was the first identified member of the autotransporter family of secreted proteins. The IgA1 protease was employed in initial experiments investigating autotransporter-mediated surface display of recombinant proteins and to investigate structural and functional requirements. Various other autotransporter proteins have since been described, and the autodisplay system was developed on the basis of the natural Escherichia coli autotransporter protein AIDA-I (adhesin involved in diffuse adherence). Autodisplay has been used for the surface display of random peptide libraries to successfully screen for novel enzyme inhibitors. The autodisplay system was also used for the surface display of functional enzymes, including esterases, oxidoreductases, and electron transfer proteins. Whole E. coli cells displaying enzymes have been utilized to efficiently synthesize industrially important rare organic compounds with specific chirality. Autodisplay of epitopes on the surface of attenuated Salmonella carriers has also provided a novel way to induce immune protection after oral vaccination. This review summarizes the structural and functional features of the autodisplay system, illustrating its discovery and most recent applications. Autodisplay facilitates the export of more than 100,000 recombinant molecules per single cell and permits the oligomerization of subunits on the cell surface as well as the incorporation of inorganic prosthetic groups after transport of apoproteins onto the bacterial surface without disturbing bacterial integrity or viability. We discuss future biotechnical and biomedical applications in the light of these achievements.\"\n",

      "\"Comparison of SUMO fusion technology with traditional gene fusion systems: Enhanced expression and solubility with SUMODespite the availability of numerous gene fusion systems, recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli remains difficult. Establishing the best fusion partner for difficult-to-express proteins remains empirical. To determine which fusion tags are best suited for difficult-to-express proteins, a comparative analysis of the newly described SUMO fusion system with a variety of commonly used fusion systems was completed. For this study, three model proteins, enhanced green florescent protein (eGFP), matrix metalloprotease-13 (MMP13), and myostatin (growth differentiating factor-8, GDF8), were fused to the C termini of maltose-binding protein (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin (TRX), NUS A, ubiquitin (Ub), and SUMO tags. These constructswere expressed in E. coli and evaluated for expression and solubility. As expected, the fusion tags varied in their ability to produce tractable quantities of soluble eGFP, MMP13, and GDF8. SUMO and NUS A fusions enhanced expression and solubility of recombinant proteins most dramatically. The ease at which SUMO and NUS A fusion tags were removed from their partner proteins was then determined. SUMO fusions are cleaved by the natural SUMO protease, while an AcTEV protease site had to be engineered between NUS A and its partner protein. A kinetic analysis showed that the SUMO and AcTEV proteases had similarK(M) values, but SUMOprotease had a 25-fold higher k(cat) than AcTEV protease, indicating a more catalytically efficient enzyme. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SUMO is superior to commonly used fusion tags in enhancing expression and solubility with the distinction of generating recombinant protein with native sequences.\"\n",

      "\"Python nidoviruses, more than respiratory pathogensIn recent years nidoviruses have emerged as an important respiratory pathogen of reptiles, affecting especially captive python populations. In pythons, nidovirus infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe and often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 nidovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether the atypical tissue tropism associates with previously unknown nidoviruses or changes in the nidovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and to obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against nidovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelial (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel nidovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing nidovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not explain the observed phenotypes. The results indicate that python nidoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated systemic spread of the virus. IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Nidoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previously evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Python nidoviruses belong to the same subfamily as the mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.\"\n",

      "\"Memory CD8 T cells mediate severe immunopathology following respiratory syncytial virus infectionMemory CD8 T cells can provide protection from re-infection by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS. However, the relative contribution of memory CD8 T cells in providing protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is currently unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we utilized a prime-boost immunization approach to induce robust memory CD8 T cell responses in the absence of RSV-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies. Unexpectedly, RSV infection of mice with pre-existing CD8 T cell memory led to exacerbated weight loss, pulmonary disease, and lethal immunopathology. The exacerbated disease in immunized mice was not epitope-dependent and occurred despite a significant reduction in RSV viral titers. In addition, the lethal immunopathology was unique to the context of an RSV infection as mice were protected from a normally lethal challenge with a recombinant influenza virus expressing an RSV epitope. Memory CD8 T cells rapidly produced IFN-γ following RSV infection resulting in elevated protein levels in the lung and periphery. Neutralization of IFN-γ in the respiratory tract reduced morbidity and prevented mortality. These results demonstrate that in contrast to other respiratory viruses, RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells can induce lethal immunopathology despite mediating enhanced viral clearance.\"\n",

      "\"Primary health care policy and vision for community pharmacy and pharmacists in SpainFrom a political and governance perspective Spain is a decentralized country with 17 states [comunidades autónomas] resulting in a governmental structure similar to a federal state. The various state regional health services organizational and management structures are focused on caring for acute illnesses and are dominated by hospitals and technology. In a review by the Interstate Council, a body for intercommunication and cooperation between the state health care services and national government, there is a move to improve health care through an integrative approach between specialized care and primary care at the state level. Community pharmacy does not appear to have a major role in this review. Primary health care is becoming more important and leading the change to improve the roles of the health care teams. Primary care pharmacists as the rest of public health professionals are employed by the respective states and are considered public servants. Total health care expenditure is 9.0% of its GDP with the public health sector accounting for the 71% and the private sector 29% of this expenditure. Community pharmacy contracts with each state health administration for the supply and dispensing of medicines and a very limited number of services. There are approximately 22,000 community pharmacies and 52,000 community pharmacists for a population of 47 million people. All community pharmacies are privately owned with only pharmacists owning a single pharmacy. Pharmacy chain stores are not legally permitted. Community pharmacy practice is based on dispensing of medications and dealing with consumer minor symptoms and requests for nonprescription medications although extensive philosophical deep debates on the conceptual and practical development of new clinical services have resulted in national consensually agreed classifications, definitions and protocolized services. There are a few remunerated services in Spain and these are funded at state, provincial or municipal level. There are no health services approved or funded at a national level. Although the profession promulgates a patient orientated community pharmacy it appears to be reluctant to advocate for a change in the remuneration model. The profession as a whole should reflect on the role of community pharmacy and advocate for a change to practice that is patient orientated alongside the maintenance of its stance on being a medication supplier. The future strategic position of community pharmacy in Spain as a primary health care partner with government would then be enhanced.\"\n",

      "\"Avian Infectious Bronchitis VirusAvian infectious bronchitis (IB) is caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belonging to Coronaviridae family. The disease is prevalent in all countries with almost 100% incidence rate. Chicken and commercially reared pheasant are the natural host for IBV. Virus causes respiratory diseases, poor weight gain, feed efficiency in broiler, damage to oviduct, and abnormal egg production in mature hens resulting in economic losses. IBV also replicates in tracheal and renal epithelial cells leading to prominent tracheal and kidney lesions. Virus undergoes spontaneous mutation leading to continual emergence of new variants. The effectiveness of immunization program is diminished because of poor cross-protection among the serotypes. Identification of circulating serotypes is important in controlling IBV infection. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR21 are involved in early recognition of virus resulting in induction of inflammatory cytokines. Both humoral and cellular immune responses are important in the control of infection. Humoral immunity plays an important role in recovery and clearance of viral infection. IBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes induce lysis of IBV-infected cells. Effective diagnostic tools are required at field level to identify different IBV variants. Embryonated chicken eggs are effective model for virus isolation. Identification by other specific methods like virus neutralization (VN), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, or nucleic acid analysis or by electron microscopy is also indispensable. VN test in tracheal organ culture is the best method for antigenic typing for surveillance purposes. Continuous epidemiological surveillance, strict biosecurity measures, and vaccine effective against various serotypes are necessary for controlling IB in chickens.\"\n",

      "\"Epidemiological characteristics and phylogenic analysis of human respiratory syncytial virus in patients with respiratory infections during 2011–2016 in southern ChinaAbstract Background Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important pathogens that cause acute respiratory infections in children and immunocompromised adults. This work was conducted to understand the epidemiological and phylogenetic features of RSV in southern China during 2011–2016. Methods A total of 16 024 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory infections in 14 hospitals, and screened for RSV and seven other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Six hundred and twenty-three RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals were further analyzed for subtypes. G gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on 46 RSV-A and 15 RSV-B strains. Results RSV was detected in 9.5% of the 16 024 specimens, the highest among the eight respiratory viruses screened. Most of these specimens came from inpatients and children under 3 years of age. The incidence of RSV-A (9.4%) was higher than that of RSV-B (4.4%) in children (<15 years), but not in adults (0.64% vs. 0.58%). A 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. The co-detection rate of RSV was 25.1%. The main prevalent genotypes were NA1, ON1, and BA9. The prevalent RSV-A genotype in 2011–2012 was NA1, close to Chongqing and Brazil, but a new Hong Kong ON1 genotype was introduced and became the prevalent genotype in Guangzhou in 2014–2015. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis confirmed the ongoing evolution and a high selection pressure of RSV-A and B strains, especially in RSV-A ON1 and NA1 genotypes. Conclusions This study demonstrated the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV in patients with respiratory infections in southern China.\"\n",

      "\"The physiology and pharmacology of singlet oxygenReactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by many different cells. Singlet oxygen (1O2) and a reaction product of it, excited carbonyls (CO(*)), are important ROS. 1O2 and CO(*) are nonradicalic and emit light (one photon/molecule) when returning to ground state oxygen. Especially activated polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) produce large amounts of 1O2. Via activation of the respiratory burst (NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase) they synthesize hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chloramines (in particular N-chlorotaurine). Chloramines are selective and stable chemical generators of 1O2. In the human organism, 1O2 is both a signal and a weapon with therapeutic potency against very different pathogens, such as microbes, virus, cancer cells and thrombi. Chloramines at blood concentrations between 1 and 2 mmol/L inactivate lipid enveloped virus and chloramines at blood concentrations below 0.5 mmol/L, i.e. at oxidant concentrations that do not affect thrombocytes or hemostasis factors, act antithrombotically by activation of the physiologic PMN mediated fibrinolysis; this thrombolysis is of selective nature, i.e. it does not impair the hemostasis system of the patient allowing the antithrombotic treatment in patients where the current risky thrombolytic treatment is contraindicated. The action of 1O2 might be compared to the signaling and destroying gunfire of soldiers directed against bandits at night, resulting in an autorecruitment of the physiological inflammatory response. Chloramines (such as the mild and untoxic oxidant chloramine T(®) (N-chloro-p-toluene-sulfonamide)) and their signaling and destroying reaction product 1O2 might be promising new therapeutic agents against a multitude of up to now refractory diseases.\"\n",

      "\"Practice does not always make perfect: need for selection curricula in modern surgical training.BACKGROUND It is hypothesized that not all surgical trainees are able to reach technical competence despite ongoing practice. The objectives of the study were to assess a trainees' ability to reach technical competence by assessing learning patterns of the acquisition of surgical skills. Furthermore, it aims to determine whether individuals' learning patterns were consistent across a range of open and laparoscopic tasks of variable difficulty. METHODS Sixty-five preclinical medical students participated in a training curriculum with standardized feedback over forty repetitions of the following laparoscopic and open technical tasks: peg transfer (PT), circle cutting (CC), intracorporeal knot tie (IKT), one-handed tie, and simulated laparotomy closure. Data mining techniques were used to analyze the prospectively collected data and stratify the students into four learning clusters. Performance was compared between groups, and learning curve characteristics unique to trainees who have difficulty reaching technical competence were quantified. RESULTS Top performers (22-35%) and high performers (32-42%) reached proficiency in all tasks. Moderate performers (25-37%) reached proficiency for all open tasks but not all laparoscopic tasks. Low performers (8-15%) failed to reach proficiency in four of five tasks including all laparoscopic tasks (PT 7.8%; CC 9.4%; IKT 15.6%). Participants in lower performance clusters demonstrated sustained performance disadvantage across tasks, with widely variable learning curves and no evidence of progression towards a plateau phase. CONCLUSIONS Most students reached proficiency across a range of surgical tasks, but low-performing trainees failed to reach competence in laparoscopic tasks. With increasing use of laparoscopy in surgical practice, screening potential candidates to identify the lowest performers may be beneficial.\"\n",

      "\"Prediction of novel mouse TLR9 agonists using a random forest approachBACKGROUND: Toll-like receptor 9 is a key innate immune receptor involved in detecting infectious diseases and cancer. TLR9 activates the innate immune system following the recognition of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs. Due to the considerable number of rotatable bonds in ODNs, high-throughput in silico screening for potential TLR9 activity via traditional structure-based virtual screening approaches of CpG ODNs is challenging. In the current study, we present a machine learning based method for predicting novel mouse TLR9 (mTLR9) agonists based on features including count and position of motifs, the distance between the motifs and graphically derived features such as the radius of gyration and moment of Inertia. We employed an in-house experimentally validated dataset of 396 single-stranded synthetic ODNs, to compare the results of five machine learning algorithms. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, we used an ensemble learning approach based on repeated random down-sampling. RESULTS: Using in-house experimental TLR9 activity data we found that random forest algorithm outperformed other algorithms for our dataset for TLR9 activity prediction. Therefore, we developed a cross-validated ensemble classifier of 20 random forest models. The average Matthews correlation coefficient and balanced accuracy of our ensemble classifier in test samples was 0.61 and 80.0%, respectively, with the maximum balanced accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient of 87.0% and 0.75, respectively. We confirmed common sequence motifs including ‘CC’, ‘GG’,‘AG’, ‘CCCG’ and ‘CGGC’ were overrepresented in mTLR9 agonists. Predictions on 6000 randomly generated ODNs were ranked and the top 100 ODNs were synthesized and experimentally tested for activity in a mTLR9 reporter cell assay, with 91 of the 100 selected ODNs showing high activity, confirming the accuracy of the model in predicting mTLR9 activity. CONCLUSION: We combined repeated random down-sampling with random forest to overcome the class imbalance problem and achieved promising results. Overall, we showed that the random forest algorithm outperformed other machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, shrinkage discriminant analysis, gradient boosting machine and neural networks. Due to its predictive performance and simplicity, the random forest technique is a useful method for prediction of mTLR9 ODN agonists.\"\n",

The infection surveillance and control resources and activities in Canadian acute care hospitals had not been assessed in 20 years. METHODS In 2000, surveys were mailed to infection control programs in all Canadian hospitals with more than 80 acute care beds. The survey was modeled after the US Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control instrument, with new items dealing with resistant pathogens and computerization. Surveillance and control indices were calculated. RESULTS One hundred seventy-two of 238 (72.3%) hospitals responded. In 42.1% of hospitals, there was fewer than 1 infection control practitioner per 250 beds. Just 60% of infection control programs had physicians or doctoral professionals with infection control training who provided services. The median surveillance index was 65.6/100, and the median control index was 60.5/100. Surgical site infection rates were reported to individual surgeons in only 36.8% of hospitals.

OBJECTIVES To assess the ability of plasma and urine NGAL to predict severe AKI in adult critically ill patients. METHODS Prospective-cohort study consisting of 632 consecutive patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Samples were analyzed by Triage immunoassay for NGAL expression. The primary outcome measure was occurrence of AKI based on Risk-Injury-Failure (RIFLE) classification during the first week of ICU stay. A total of 171 (27%) patients developed AKI. Of these 67, 48, and 56 were classified as RIFLE R, I, and F, respectively. Plasma and urine NGAL values at ICU admission were significantly related to AKI severity. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for plasma and urine NGAL were for RIFLE R (0.77 ± 0.05 and 0.80 ± 0.04, respectively), RIFLE I (0.80 ± 0.06 and 0.85 ± 0.04, respectively), and RIFLE F (0.86 ± 0.06 and 0.88 ± 0.04, respectively) and comparable with those of admission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (0.84 ± 0.04, 0.87 ± 0.04, and 0.92 ± 0.04, respectively). Plasma and urine NGAL significantly contributed to the accuracy of the \"most efficient clinical model\" with the best four variables including eGFR, improving the area under the curve for RIFLE F prediction to 0.96 ± 0.02 and 0.95 ± 0.01. Serial NGAL measurements did not provide additional information for the prediction of RIFLE F. CONCLUSIONS NGAL measured at ICU admission predicts the development of severe AKI similarly to serum creatinine-derived eGFR. However, NGAL adds significant accuracy to this prediction in combination with eGFR alone or with other clinical parameters and has an interesting predictive value in patients with normal serum creatinine.\"\n",

      "\"Cost-Effectiveness of Lifestyle-Related Interventions for the Primary Prevention of Breast Cancer: A Rapid Review.Background: In 2018, the global estimate of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases among women totaled 2.1 million. The economic and social burden that breast cancer places on societies has propelled research that analyzes the role of modifiable risk factors as the primary prevention methods. Healthy behavior changes, moderated alcohol intake, healthy body weight, and regular physical activity may decrease the risk of breast cancer among women. This review aimed to synthesize evidence on the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle-related interventions for the primary prevention of breast cancer in order to answer the question on whether implementing interventions focused on behavior changes are worth the value for money. Methods: A rapid review was performed using search terms developed by the research team. The articles were retrieved from MEDLINE and the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, with an additional web search in Google and Google Scholar. Comparisons were performed on the cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year between the interventions using a league table, and the likelihood of cost-effective interventions for breast cancer primary prevention was analyzed. Results: Six studies were selected. The median cost-effectiveness ratio (in 2018 USD) was $24,973, and 80% of the interventions had a ratio below the $50,000 threshold. The low-fat-diet program for postmenopausal women was cost-effective at a societal level, and the physical activity interventions, such as the Be Active Program in the UK, had the best cost saving results. A total of 11 of the 25 interventions ranked either as highly or very highly likely to be cost-effective for breast cancer primary preventions. Conclusion: Although the review had some limitations due to using only a few studies, it showed evidence that diet-related and physical-activity-related interventions for the primary prevention of breast cancer were cost-effective. Many of the cost-effective interventions aimed to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases alongside breast cancer.\"\n",

Emergency liver resection during active bleeding in a patient who takes anticoagulant therapy is a complicated and high-risk surgery. Aim. We described a technique that is combination of staplers, total hepatic vascular occlusion, and hemostatic agent (TachoSil) application for safe and quick hepatectomy. Patient and Method. A 72-year-old woman who uses warfarin regularly due to valvuloplasty admitted emergency unit with abdominal pain and shock. At admission, her hemoglobin, hematocrit, and INR values were 5.2 g/dL, 14.9%, and 6.7, respectively. Radiologic evaluation revealed abdominal free fluid and a liver lesion on segments V, VI, and VII. Emergency laparotomy was required. There was an active bleeding from a liver hematoma that could not be controlled by packing, and an urgent hepatic resection was required. Under total hepatic vascular occlusion, segments V, VI, and VII were resected with endoscopic nonvascular staplers. Cut surface of the liver was coagulated with bipolar cautery and covered with a hemostatic material. Results. Hepatectomy took six minutes, and the duration of surgery was 80 minutes. There was no complication and no transfusion required after surgery, and the patient was discharged on 8th day, uneventfully. Conclusion. Emergency hepatectomy with staplers, under vascular control with hemostatic agents, provided a rapid and safe surgery.\"\n",

      "\"Feasibility of a birth cohort study dedicated to assessing acute infections using symptom diaries and parental collection of biomaterialsBACKGROUND: A birth cohort dedicated to studying infections in early childhood may be assisted by parental recording of symptoms on a daily basis and a collection of biomaterials. We aimed at testing the feasibility of this approach for use in a long-term study focusing on infections in children in Germany. METHODS: Parents of 1- to 3-year-old children (n = 75) were recruited in nursery schools. They were asked to complete a symptom diary on a daily basis and to take monthly and symptom-triggered nasal swabs and stool samples from their child over the study period of three months. Feasibility was measured by means of the return proportions of symptom diaries and bio samples; acceptance was assessed by a questionnaire delivered to participants at the end of the study. RESULTS: The majority of the participants filled in the symptom diary during the three months study for 75 or more days (77.3 %), and provided the monthly nasal swabs (62.7 %) and stool samples (65.3 %). The time needed for the tasks was acceptable for most participants (symptom diary: 92.3 %, nasal swabs: 98.5 %, stool samples: 100.0 %). In 64.3 % of the symptom-triggered nasal swabs, respiratory viruses were found compared to 55.5 % in throat swabs taken by health-care professionals within the “ARE surveillance Lower Saxony”, a special project by the Governmental Institute of Public Health of Lower Saxony to investigate causal pathogens for acute respiratory infections in children. CONCLUSIONS: The parental assessment of symptoms and collection of biomaterials in a birth cohort dedicated to studying infections appears feasible in a middle class German population. The success of the study will depend on the ability to maintain these activities over a long time period.

      "\"Animal Disease Surveillance in the 21st Century: Applications and Robustness of Phylodynamic Methods in Recent U.S. Human-Like H3 Swine Influenza OutbreaksEmerging and endemic animal viral diseases continue to impose substantial impacts on animal and human health. Most current and past molecular surveillance studies of animal diseases investigated spatio-temporal and evolutionary dynamics of the viruses in a disjointed analytical framework, ignoring many uncertainties and made joint conclusions from both analytical approaches. Phylodynamic methods offer a uniquely integrated platform capable of inferring complex epidemiological and evolutionary processes from the phylogeny of viruses in populations using a single Bayesian statistical framework. In this study, we reviewed and outlined basic concepts and aspects of phylodynamic methods and attempted to summarize essential components of the methodology in one analytical pipeline to facilitate the proper use of the methods by animal health researchers. Also, we challenged the robustness of the posterior evolutionary parameters, inferred by the commonly used phylodynamic models, using hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2) segments of the currently circulating human-like H3 swine influenza (SI) viruses isolated in the United States and multiple priors. Subsequently, we compared similarities and differences between the posterior parameters inferred from sequence data using multiple phylodynamic models. Our suggested phylodynamic approach attempts to reduce the impact of its inherent limitations to offer less biased and biologically plausible inferences about the pathogen evolutionary characteristics to properly guide intervention activities. We also pinpointed requirements and challenges for integrating phylodynamic methods in routine animal disease surveillance activities.\"\n",

However, the current paradigm does not prevent all transfusion-transmitted infections and is reactive to new agents, thus accepting that some patients may be harmed before preventive measures are introduced. Several methods are now available that selectively damage DNA and RNA, thus inactivating pathogens contaminating blood components while not damaging the cells or plasma proteins of the blood component. Clinical trials have been completed and pathogen-inactivated platelets and plasma are widely used in Europe. A recent consensus conference recommended implementation of pathogen inactivation when a feasible and safe method is available that inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogens.

Recent data suggest an association between specific genotypes and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. This includes inflammatory responses (i.e. TNF-α, Il-10), infectious diseases such as pneumonia or meningitis, sepsis, ARDS, as well as the mortality of critically injured patients (polytrauma, severe brain trauma).

With the help of thousands of viral genome sequences that have been accumulating, it has become possible to track the evolution of viral genome over time as it spread across the world. An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C>T mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C>T mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C>T, has the opposite effect. It is possible that 14408C>T mutation may have contributed to the dominance of its co-mutations in Europe and elsewhere.\"\n",

The purified recombinant polypeptide was employed to develop an ELISA test for the detection of TGEV-like CCoV-specific antibodies in dog sera. Four canine sera positive for TGEV-like CCoV, six sera positive to classical CCoV-II strains and 10 negative control sera were examined. The recombinant S′ was not recognized by antibodies to classical CCoV-II, as only sera from dogs infected experimentally with TGEV-like CCoV reacted strongly with the recombinant S′ polypeptide whereas dog sera with antibodies to classical CCoV-II did not react. As classical CCoV-II and TEGV-like CCoVs are related antigenically, the recombinant S′ ELISA is a useful method to investigate serologically the prevalence of TGEV-like CCoVs in dogs.\"\n",

      "\"Testování COVID-19 - co bychom měli mít na paměti./ Testing for COVID-19: a few points to rememberDiagnostic approaches to COVID-19 include clinical history, PCR tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus and detection of antibodies. By combining these three approaches, the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be examined in healthcare teams. The aim of the study was to examine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a population of healthcare professionals 6 - 8 weeks after the first COVID-19 case was detected in the Czech Republic. A total of 269 subjects were enrolled in the study (187 women, 82 men) with a median age of 45.9 years (21 - 71 years). We used a questionnaire to ascertain travel history and clinical signs of any respiratory tract infection. Blood samples were collected, and IgG levels were analysed in all samples. The level of IgA antibodies was analysed in those positive for IgG. PCR testing was performed in cases testing positive for presence of antibodies. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test system for SARS-CoV-2 from Euroimmun (Germany) was used to analyse immunoglobulin levels. 17 % of the tested cohort reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and 35.8 % reported history of international travel. There were 5 subjects positive IgG cases (of 269; 1.85 %), and one IgA positive and IgG borderline positive subject (0.37 %). There was only one PCR positive subject. Anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were thus detected in 2.22% of participating health professionals. This article shows the pitfalls of the testing methods and highlights the necessity of using a correct testing algorithm, considering the character of the tested population and the expected low prevalence.\"\n",

      "\"Geospatial Hotspots Need Point-of-Care Strategies to Stop Highly Infectious Outbreaks: Ebola and Coronavirus.Context. Point-of-care testing (POCT), diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient care, is inherently spatial, that is, performed at points of need, and also intrinsically temporal, because it produces fast actionable results. Outbreaks generate geospatial \"hotspots.\" POC strategies help control hotspots, detect spread, and speed treatment of highly infectious diseases. Objectives. To stop outbreaks, accelerate detection, facilitate emergency response for epidemics, mobilize public health practitioners, enhance community resilience, and improve crisis standards of care. Data Sources. PubMed, WWW, newsprint, others were searched until COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, the US, a national emergency, and Europe, the epicenter. Coverage comprised interviews in Asia, email to/from Wuhan, papers, articles, chapters, documents, maps, flowcharts, schematics, and geospatial-associated concepts. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated literature as abstracts, ULRs, and PDFs, recovering 136 hotspot articles. More than 500 geospatial science articles were assessed for relevance to point-of-care testing. Conclusions POCT can interrupt spirals of dysfunction and delay by enhancing disease detection, decision making, contagion containment, and safe spacing, thereby softening outbreak surges and diminishing risk before human, economic, and cultural losses mount. Point-of-care tests results identify where infected individuals spread COVID-19, when delays cause death, and how to deploy resources. Results in national cloud databases help optimize outbreak control, mitigation, emergency response, and community resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates unequivocally that governments must support POCT and multidisciplinary healthcare personnel must learn its principles, then adopt POC geospatial strategies, so that onsite diagnostic testing can ramp up to meet needs in times of crisis.\"\n",

      "\"Role of Host Cell Secretory Machinery in Zika Virus Life CycleThe high human cost of Zika virus infections and the rapid establishment of virus circulation in novel areas, including the United States, present an urgent need for countermeasures against this emerging threat. The development of an effective vaccine against Zika virus may be problematic because of the cross reactivity of the antibodies with other flaviviruses leading to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Moreover, rapidly replicating positive strand RNA viruses, including Zika virus, generate large spectrum of mutant genomes (quasi species) every replication round, allowing rapid selection of variants resistant to drugs targeting virus-specific proteins. On the other hand, viruses are ultimate cellular parasites and rely on the host metabolism for every step of their life cycle, thus presenting an opportunity to manipulate host processes as an alternative approach to suppress virus replication and spread. Zika and other flaviviruses critically depend on the cellular secretory pathway, which transfers proteins and membranes from the ER through the Golgi to the plasma membrane, for virion assembly, maturation and release. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of interactions of Zika and similar arthropod-borne flaviviruses with the cellular secretory machinery with a special emphasis on virus-specific changes of the secretory pathway. Identification of the regulatory networks and effector proteins required to accommodate the trafficking of virions, which represent a highly unusual cargo for the secretory pathway, may open an attractive and virtually untapped reservoir of alternative targets for the development of superior anti-viral drugs.\"\n",

      "\"Minimal Access Gardening: Laparoscopic Techniques during Coronavirus Disease LockdownOBJECTIVE: To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic surgery while all elective procedures are suspended. DESIGN: Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques. SETTING: Gynecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom. INTERVENTIONS: Owing to the coronavirus disease pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom. In addition, there have been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease [1,2]. As a result, laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration, and it is uncertain whether this may have an impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated. Combining gardening, one of the major pastimes during the lockdown period, and minimal access surgical skills, this video demonstrates the different ways minimal access surgery may be applied to horticulture. In the first described technique, what the author believes to be hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) was excised using a grasper and a tripolar cutting device (Fig. 1). For obvious reasons diathermy is not available within the home environment, but the retractable cutting blade was used to efficiently slice through the stems required for weed removal. The disadvantage of this technique is clearly that the unwanted species is likely to regrow in 12 months. In the second described technique, dandelions (genus Taraxacum) (Fig. 2), which are native to Eurasia and North America, were excised at the flowering stage, thereby effectively preventing asexual reproduction by apomixis. The technique similarly uses the retractable blade of the tripolar cutting device. The third technique demonstrates harvesting of an unknown species using a soil dissection technique. To facilitate complete removal of the plant and to reduce the risk of recurrence, the roots are carefully dissected out using blunt dissection. As with many techniques, patience is of paramount importance. Last, ensuring hydration of plants is crucial to their early stage of development. Laparoscopic watering techniques are usually simplified when an irrigation and suction device is employed. However, within a low-resource setting a slow process of \"cup feeding\" is required and requires meticulous dexterity (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, during this demonstration a common complication of a loss of instrument occurred, but the subject was luckily successfully hydrated. CONCLUSION: While a lockdown remains in place, many gynecologists are not able to maintain their laparoscopic surgical skills. It is important to combine activities of daily living with minimal access training to maintain our physical and mental well-being. More research is clearly needed in the area of minimal access horticulture to expand this new and exciting subspecialty.\"\n",

      "\"Mouse models for graft arteriosclerosis.Graft arteriosclerois (GA), also called allograft vasculopathy, is a pathologic lesion that develops over months to years in transplanted organs characterized by diffuse, circumferential stenosis of the entire graft vascular tree. The most critical component of GA pathogenesis is the proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells within the intima. When a human coronary artery segment is interposed into the infra-renal aortae of immunodeficient mice, the intimas could be expand in response to adoptively transferred human T cells allogeneic to the artery donor or exogenous human IFN-γ in the absence of human T cells. Interposition of a mouse aorta from one strain into another mouse strain recipient is limited as a model for chronic rejection in humans because the acute cell-mediated rejection response in this mouse model completely eliminates all donor-derived vascular cells from the graft within two-three weeks. We have recently developed two new mouse models to circumvent these problems. The first model involves interposition of a vessel segment from a male mouse into a female recipient of the same inbred strain (C57BL/6J). Graft rejection in this case is directed only against minor histocompatibility antigens encoded by the Y chromosome (present in the male but not the female) and the rejection response that ensues is sufficiently indolent to preserve donor-derived smooth muscle cells for several weeks. The second model involves interposing an artery segment from a wild type C57BL/6J mouse donor into a host mouse of the same strain and gender that lacks the receptor for IFN-γ followed by administration of mouse IFN-γ (delivered via infection of the mouse liver with an adenoviral vector. There is no rejection in this case as both donor and recipient mice are of the same strain and gender but donor smooth muscle cells proliferate in response to the cytokine while host-derived cells, lacking receptor for this cytokine, are unresponsive. By backcrossing additional genetic changes into the vessel donor, both models can be used to assess the effect of specific genes on GA progression. Here, we describe detailed protocols for our mouse GA models.\"\n",

      "\"Coronavirus disease-19 and fertility: viral host entry protein expression in male and female reproductive tissuesOBJECTIVE: To identify cell types in the male and female reproductive systems at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the expression of host genes and proteins used by the virus for cell entry. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. SETTING: Academic research department and clinical diagnostic laboratory. PATIENT(S): Not applicable (focus was on previously generated gene and protein expression data). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Identification of cell types coexpressing the key angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes and proteins as well as other candidates potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. RESULT(S): On the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing data, coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not detected in testicular cells, including sperm. A subpopulation of oocytes in nonhuman primate ovarian tissue was found to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but coexpression was not observed in ovarian somatic cells. RNA expression of TMPRSS2 in 18 samples of human cumulus cells was shown to be low or absent. There was general agreement between publicly available bulk RNA and protein datasets in terms of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression patterns in testis, ovary, endometrial, and placental cells. CONCLUSION(S): These analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is unlikely to have long-term effects on male and female reproductive function. Although the results cannot be considered definitive, they imply that procedures in which oocytes are collected and fertilized in vitro are associated with very little risk of viral transmission from gametes to embryos and may indeed have the potential to minimize exposure of susceptible reproductive cell types to infection in comparison with natural conception.\"\n",

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination of 19 patients with COVID-19 from the Liyuan Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) between January 16, 2020 and February 20, 2020 was undertaken. RESULTS: There were 11 male and 8 female cases among the patients. The median (range) age was 73 (38–91) years. Of these patients, 8 (42.1%) had died and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 2 (interquartile range (IQR): 1–10.75) days. Seven of these 8 patients had underlying diseases. The auxiliary examination showed fever (68.4%), dry cough (15.8%), dyspnea (10.5%), and diarrhea (5.3%). All 19 cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography. Serum hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum amylase A (SAA) were clearly increased in all of the cases. Among the 19 cases, there were 16 (84.2%) cases in which the total number of lymphocytes decreased, 12 cases (63%) had reduced liver function, and 11 cases (58%) had deviant results for fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer, in particular, the D-dimer level was significantly higher in the non-survivors compared with the survivors. CONCLUSION: There were more men than women among critically ill patients. All of the cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography and the vast majority of patients displayed fever and dry cough. The clinical laboratory indices change significantly, especially the D-dimer level among non-survivors.\"\n",

      "\"Avoiding Diverting Ileostomy in Patients Requiring Complete Pelvic Peritonectomy.BACKGROUND In performing cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic perioperative chemotherapy, a rectosigmoid colon resection is frequently required. To reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage at the colorectal anastomoses, a diverting ileostomy has been recommended in these patients. METHODS Stripping of mesorectal fat from the rectum up to the peritoneal reflection allows transection of the rectum at the junction of the upper and middle rectum. A suture pulls in the lateral aspects of the rectal staple line so that this staple line is included within the barrel of the stapler. After the circular-stapled anastomoses is complete, a second layer of silk sutures is used to invert the staple line. RESULTS In 31 stapled colorectal anastomoses, three rectal transections were so low that a layer of sutures was not possible. In the 29 two-layer colorectal anastomoses, no anastomotic leakages were observed. The incidence of diverting ileostomy was reduced from 50 to 7 %. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that preservation of a 10-15 cm length of rectum allows a second layer of sutures to be placed over the stapled colorectal anastomoses. This is a safe alternative to a diverting ileostomy in selected patients.\"\n",

      "\"Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Patency after Flow-Diverting Stent Treatment.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The rate of PICA occlusion after flow-diverting stent placement for vertebral and vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms is not known. The purpose of this study is to determine the medium-term rate of PICA patency and risk factors for occlusion after such aneurysm treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients were identified who had vertebral or vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms and who were treated by placing a flow-diverting stent across the PICA ostium. Demographic and procedural factors associated with stent placement were recorded. Patency of the PICA was evaluated immediately after stent placement and on follow-up angiography. RESULTS Thirteen patients with vertebral or vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms were treated in the study period, of whom 4 presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The average number of devices that spanned the PICA ostium was 1.77 (range, 1-3), with no immediate PICA occlusions. There were no postoperative strokes in the treated PICA territory, although there was 1 contralateral PICA-territory stroke of unclear etiology without clinical sequelae. In 11 patients with follow-up angiography at a mean of 10.6 months (range, 0.67-27.9 months), the PICA patency rate remained 100%. CONCLUSIONS Flow-diverting stent placement across the PICA ostium in the treatment of vertebral and vertebrobasilar artery aneurysms may not result in immediate or midterm PICA occlusion.\"\n",

      "\"Threat to democracy: Physical and mental health impact of democracy movement in Hong KongAbstract Background This study examined the prevalence and critical predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms and self-rated health, following the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. Methods: Random digit dialing recruited a population-representative sample of 1208 Chinese Hong Kong citizens (mean age=46.89 years; 63% female) in the first two weeks of February 2015. Respondents gave their informed consent and reported personal, social, and economic resource loss since the Umbrella Movement (Conservation of Resources-Evaluation), current anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and self-rated health (1=very good, 4=very bad). Results A total of 47.35% (95% CI=44.55, 50.17) respondents reported moderate/severe anxiety symptoms and 14.4% (95% CI=12.54, 16.50) reported moderate/severe depressive symptoms; 9.11% (95% CI=7.61, 10.86) reported “poor” or “very poor” health. Multivariable regressions revealed that personal and social resource loss was associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms and greater odds of “very poor” health (adjusted odds ratios/incidence rate ratios=5–102%), independent of lower education level and income and being unmarried. Limitations This study was cross-sectional in nature and thus could not determine causality from the associations between resource loss and outcome variables. Second, the telephone survey relied on self-reports; response bias and social desirability could influence respondents' answers and discount data validity. Third, potential confounders such as preexisting mental and physical health issues and concurrent predictors like exposure to the Umbrella Movement were not assessed. Conclusions This is one of the first studies following any recent political movement (e.g., The Arab Spring) to quantify distress and the associated correlates of distress among affected citizens. Perceived psychosocial resource losses were critical predictors of poor outcomes.\"\n",

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A retrospective study was performed of all hospitalized patients at the peak of the pH1N1 season in whom a single respiratory virus was detected by a molecular assay targeting 18 viruses/subtypes (RVP, Luminex xTAG). Fifty-two percent (615/1192) of patients from October, 2009 to December, 2009 had a single respiratory virus (291 pH1N1; 207 rhinovirus; 45 RSV A/B; 37 parainfluenza; 27 adenovirus; 6 coronavirus; and 2 metapneumovirus). No seasonal influenza A or B was detected. Individuals with pH1N1, compared to other viruses, were more likely to present with fever (92% & 70%), cough (92% & 86%), sore throat (32% & 16%), nausea (31% & 8%), vomiting (39% & 30%), abdominal pain (14% & 7%), and a lower white blood count (8,500/L & 13,600/L, all p-values<0.05). In patients with cough and gastrointestinal complaints, the presence of subjective fever/chills independently raised the likelihood of pH1N1 (OR 10). Fifty-five percent (336/615) of our cohort received antibacterial agents, 63% (385/615) received oseltamivir, and 41% (252/615) received steroids. The mortality rate of our cohort was 1% (7/615) and was higher in individuals with pH1N1 compared to other viruses (2.1% & 0.3%, respectively; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: During the peak pandemic 2009–2010 influenza season in Rhode Island, nearly half of patients admitted with influenza-like symptoms had respiratory viruses other than influenza A. A high proportion of patients were treated with antibiotics and pH1N1 infection had higher mortality compared to other respiratory viruses.\"\n",

      "\"Tackling COVID-19 Pandemic through Nanocoatings: Confront and ExactitudeAbstract After the eruption of the most deadly influenza flu pandemic in 1918, also known as Spanish flu, infected about 500 million people with a death toll of approximately 50 million globally, the second most devastating pandemic flue emerged in December 2019 at Wuhan (Hubei Province) of China. This viral disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 was named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO). The COVID-19 virus affected 213 countries globally with 5.6 million cases and 353,373 deaths as of May 28, 2020 [1] (Fig. 1). Still, there is no promising solution known to tackle this severe epidemic disease worldwide. Protecting the global population from COVID-19 we must follow three steps – early detection, monitoring, and treatment. At the same time, it is important to follow WHO guidelines on preventive measures. Many countries have restricted the movement of people completely and lockdown enforced to maintain social distancing. But lockdown alone is insufficient to prevent resurgence, can upend economies and roil society. People need to step out to perform essential tasks and may get exposed to this deadly virus. Learnings from previous outbreaks suggest the usage of nanotechnology as an important avenue to develop antiviral drugs and materials. So, to effectively minimize the acquired infection of COVID-19 in public places like hospitals, transport, schools, worship places, stores, malls, etc. antimicrobial nanocoatings at these places and development of targeted antiviral drugs through capped nanoparticles will be a major effective option to tackle the spread of this disease.\"\n",

      "\"Epitope mapping and biological function analysis of antibodies produced by immunization of mice with an inactivated Chinese isolate of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)Abstract Inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been tested as a candidate vaccine against the re-emergence of SARS. In order to understand the efficacy and safety of this approach, it is important to know the antibody specificities generated with inactivated SARS-CoV. In the current study, a panel of twelve monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was established by immunizing Balb/c mice with the inactivated BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV isolated from the lung tissue of a SARS-infected Chinese patient. These mAbs could recognize SARS-CoV-infected cells by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA). Seven of them were mapped to the specific segments of recombinant spike (S) protein: six on S1 subunit (aa 12–798) and one on S2 subunit (aa 797–1192). High neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV were detected with two mAbs (1A5 and 2C5) targeting at a subdomain of S protein (aa 310–535), consistent with the previous report that this segment of S protein contains the major neutralizing domain. Some of these S-specific mAbs were able to recognize cleaved products of S protein in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. None of the remaining five mAbs could recognize either of the recombinant S, N, M, or E antigens by ELISA. This study demonstrated that the inactivated SARS-CoV was able to preserve the immunogenicity of S protein including its major neutralizing domain. The relative ease with which these mAbs were generated against SARS-CoV virions further supports that subunit vaccination with S constructs may also be able to protect animals and perhaps humans. It is somewhat unexpected that no N-specific mAbs were identified albeit anti-N IgG was easily identified in SARS-CoV-infected patients. The availability of this panel of mAbs also provided potentially useful agents with applications in therapy, diagnosis, and basic research of SARS-CoV.\"\n",

      "\"Faecal retention: a common cause in functional bowel disorders, appendicitis and haemorrhoids--with medical and surgical therapy.The present studies explored whether faecal retention in the colon is a causative factor in functional bowel disease, appendicitis, and haemorrhoids. Faecal retention was characterized by colon transit time (CTT) after radio-opaque marker ingestion and estimation of faecal loading on abdominal radiographs at 48 h and 96 h. Specific hypotheses were tested in patients (n = 251 plus 281) and in healthy random controls (n = 44). A questionnaire was completed for each patient, covering abdominal and anorectal symptoms and without a priori grouping. Patients with functional bowel disorders, predominantly women, had a significantly increased CTT and faecal load compared to controls. The CTT was significantly and positively correlated with segmental and total faecal loading. The faecal load was equal at 48 h and 96 h, mirroring the presence of permanent faecal reservoirs. In these first clinical studies to correlate bowel symptoms with CTT and colon faecal loading, abdominal bloating was significantly correlated with faecal loading in the right colon, total faecal load, and CTT. Abdominal pain was significantly and positively correlated to distal faecal loading and significantly associated with bloating. A new phenomenon with a high faecal load and a normal CTT was observed in a subset of patients (n = 90), proving faecal retention as hidden constipation. The CTT and faecal load were significantly higher in the right-side compared to the left and distal segments. Within the control group of healthy persons, the right-sided faecal load was significantly greater than the left and distal load. The CTT and faecal load significantly positively correlated with a palpable mass in the left iliac fossa and meteorism. Cluster analysis revealed that CTT and faecal load positively correlated with a symptom factor consisting of bloating, proctalgia and infrequent defecation of solid faeces. On the other hand, CTT and faecal load negatively correlated with a symptom factor comprising frequent easy defecations, repetitiveness, and incompleteness with solid or liquid faeces. The majority of patients with a heavy faecal load but normal CTT had repetitive daily defecation, mostly with ease and with altering faecal consistence. Flue-like episodes co-existed in symptom factors with abdominal pain and meteorism, and these symptoms together with a palpable right iliac fossa mass and tenderness, and in other factors with seldom and difficult defecation, and with epigastric discomfort and halitosis. Patients with seldom and difficult defecation of solid faeces experienced abdominal pain significantly more often and presented a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa with tenderness and meteorism. The CTT was significantly prolonged and faecal load significantly increased. In patients with a normal CTT and increased faecal load, only patients with abdominal pain had a significant correlation between faecal loading and bloating. CTT and faecal load were shown for the first time to increase significantly with the number of colonic redundancies (colon length), which also resulted in significantly increased bloating and pain. Intervention with a bowel stimulation regimen combining a fibre-rich diet, fluid, physical activity, and a prokinetic drug was essential to proving that abdominal symptoms and defecation disorders are caused by faecal retention, with or without a prolonged CTT. The CTT was significantly reduced, as was faecal load. Bloating and pain were reduced significantly. The defecation became easy with solid faeces, towards one per day and with significant reductions in incompleteness and repetitiveness. Proctalgia and flue-like episodes were significantly reduced. The intervention significantly reduced the presence of a tender palpable mass in the right fossa and rectal constipation. In patients with a normal CTT but increased faecal load, the intervention did not significantly change the CTT or load, but bloating and pain were significantly reduced, just as defecation improved overall. The novel knowledge of faecal retention in the patients does not explain why faecal retention occurs. However, it may be inferred from the present results that a constipated or irritable bowel may belong to the same underlying disease dimension, where faecal retention is a common factor. Thus, measuring CTT and faecal load is suggested as a guide to a positive functional diagnosis of bowel disorders compared to the constellation of symptoms alone. Thirty-five patients underwent surgery after being refractory to the conservative treatment for constipation. They had a significantly prolonged CTT and heavy faecal loading, which was responsible for the aggravated abdominal and defaecatory symptoms. The operated patients presented with a redundant colon (dolichocolon) significantly more often. These patients also had an extremely high rate of previous appendectomy. Twenty-one patients underwent hemicolectomy, and 11 patients had a subtotal colectomy with an ileosigmoidal anastomosis; three patients received a stoma. However, some patients had to have the initial segmental colectomy converted to a final subtotal colectomy because of persisting symptoms. Six more subtotal colectomies have been performed and the leakage rate of all colectomies is then 4.9 % (one patient died). After a mean follow-up of 5 years, the vast majority of patients were without abdominal pain and bloating, having two to four defecations daily with control and their quality of life had increased considerably. A faecalith is often located in the appendix, the occlusion of which is responsible for many cases of acute appendicitis, which is infrequent in all except white populations. An effort to trace the origin of the faecalith to faecal retention in the colon was made in a case control study (56 patients and 44 random controls). The CTT was longer and faecal load greater in patients with appendicitis compared to controls, though the difference was not significant. Power calculations showed that more patients were needed to reach statistical significance for these parameters. The presence of a faecalith was most often associated with a gangrenous or perforated appendix. No significant differences were found between the CTT and faecal load of patients who had or did not have a faecalith. However, the right-sided faecal load was significantly higher than the left and distal load. Haemorrhoids are often a consequence of constipation and defaecatory disorders and were found in every second patient with functional bowel disorders. The present studies are the first Danish reports of a novel operation to cure this disease, stapled haemorrhoidopexy (n = 40 and 258 patients). The majority of patients had prolapsed haemorrhoids, and the durability of procedure was confirmed with a follow-up of up to 5 years, meaning a normal anus. The operation time was short, post-operative pain was low, and recovery was rapid. No incontinence was observed, and patient satisfaction was high and significantly correlated with the appearance of a normal anus without prolapse. The cumulative risk of re-operation was greatest in the first 2 years after the stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Patients with persisting haemorrhoidal prolapse had the procedure repeated with results as good as those obtained in the rest of the patients. It was shown in a statistical model that the preoperative severity of haemorrhoidal disease and the immediate postoperative result contributed significantly to predicting the outcome that is the durability of the operation. The most frequent post-operative complication was bleeding requiring surgical haemostasis. One serious complication occurred after an anastomotic leak from a highly placed anastomosis, resulting in retro rectal, retro- and intra-peritoneal, and mediastinal gas. The patient recovered after conservative treatment and without surgical intervention. The stapling technique now used has revolutionized the surgical treatment of prolapsing haemorrhoids. Finally, a common cause may be suspected for diseases constantly associated with one another. Epidemiological evidence has recognized that constipation, diverticulosis and IBS increase the risk of colon cancer (and adenomas), diseases exceedingly rare in communities exempt from appendicitis. Haemorrhoids are a colonic co-morbidity as well. Notably, the patients with a functional bowel disorder had a much higher rate of a previous appendectomy than the background population. In addition, the patients who had previously had an appendectomy had a significantly longer CTT compared to patients, who had not. The data points to the involvement of faecal retention in the origin of faecaliths and, thus, acute appendicitis. Faecal reservoirs were shown in the right and left colon segments in both patients and controls, which are the same areas bearing the highest incidences of adenomateous polyps and malignancies. Familial colorectal cancer occurred significantly more often in patients who had a higher faecal load than the controls. Four malignancies and 25 adenomas were identified. An increased faecal load in the colon with or without delayed transit will increase bacterial counts and create a chronic inflammation of the colonic mucosa, which is a risk factor for cancer onset. A functional bowel disorder is then likely to occur with gradually transition from a primary functional disease into specific organic diseases. A diet rich in fibre and regular physical activity have a therapeutic and preventive effect on colorectal diseases associated with faecal retention. A “common cause” was earlier proposed for constipation, colon diverticula, cancer, appendicitis, and haemorrhoids. The actual results of the present studies support this unifying theory for these diet-related diseases, in which the functional retention of faeces maybe the common cause.\"\n",

      "\"Prognosis of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia correlates with perivascular CD4+ T lymphocyte infiltration of the lungBACKGROUND: Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is characterized by interstitial infiltration of T lymphocytes, and subpopulations of these cells may be associated with the progression of fibrosis. However, few studies evaluate the correlation of prognosis with this characteristic. Therefore, we performed morphological and quantitative analyses of T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP and evaluated the relationship between T lymphocytes and prognosis. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 55 biopsies of patients with NSIP to determine the numbers of these T cell subpopulations in lymphoid follicles as well as in perivascular, interstitial, and peribronchial anatomical compartments. The relationship between CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations and prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of 55 patients was 48.9 ± 10.5 years, and 36 (65 %) of patients were women. All patients were followed for a mean duration of 46 ± 25 months. Thirteen (23.6 %) patients died during follow-up. Perivascular CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration (HR, 0.939; 95 % CI, 0.883–0.999; p = 0.048) was an independent risk factor for survival. Perivascular infiltrates of CD4+ T lymphocytes correlated with survival time (r = 0.270, p = 0.046). Patients with improved forced vital capacity survived longer and had higher numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes that infiltrated perivascular tissue. The densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrating other tissues were not significantly associated with survival time. CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP correlated with prognosis. The underlying mechanisms are unknown and require further studies.

Specimens were harvested 7, 21, 90, and 180 days after surgery and evaluated histologically for inflammation, neovascularization, and collagen deposition. RESULTS All materials and sham sites induced a mild to moderate inflammation that decreased over time, except for human dermis, which elicited a moderate to severe inflammatory response. The responses were varied and measurable using subjective scoring methods. The sphere-templated scaffold demonstrated numerous foreign body giant cells adjacent to the silicone granules, which were not seen in any of the other specimens. CONCLUSION Subjective scoring of pathology slides and measurement of capsule thickness appeared to show differences between the materials, but these differences require a larger number of subjects and proper statistical analysis to assess. The robust foreign body reaction elicited by the polypropylene/silicone-based scaffold argues against the use of this material in future studies. The authors advocate using inert biodegradable substances for future bioscaffold constructs.\"\n",

The alkynes 30a−d and 31a−d were applied in the 1,3‐dipolar cycloadditions with azides 27 and 28 to synthesize acyclic 1,2,3‐triazole nucleosides. The obtained alkynes and 1,2,3‐triazole were evaluated for antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. The alkyne 30d showed activity against adenovirus‐2 (EC(50) = 8.3 μM), while compounds 37a and 37d were also active toward herpes simplex virus‐1 wild‐type and thymidine kinase deficient (HSV‐1 TK(−)) strains (EC(50) values in the range of 4.6–13.8 μM). In addition, compounds 30a, 30b, 37b, and 37c exhibited activity toward varicella‐zoster virus (VZV) TK(+) and TK(−) strains (EC(50) = 2.1–9.5 μM). The compound 30b proved to be the most selective against VZV and displayed marginal activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Although the compound 30a had improved anti‐HCMV activity, the increase in anti‐HCMV activity was accompanied by significant toxicity. Compounds 37a and 37d showed inhibitory effects toward the human T lymphocyte (CEM) cell line (IC(50) = 21 ± 7 and 22 ± 1 μM, respectively), while compound 35 exhibited cytostatic activity toward HMEC‐1 cells (IC(50) = 28 ± 2 μM).\"\n",

The present study applies technetium-99m-mercapto-acetyl-tri-glycine [99mTc-MAG3] scintigraphy for the longitudinal follow-up examination of long-term kidney function after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS Unilateral warm ischemia was induced in scid beige mice by vascular clamping of the kidney hilum for 40 min. 99mTc-MAG3 scintigraphy was performed prior to injury, 8 and 14 days post ischemia. The fractional uptake rate [FUR] was calculated from scintigraphy data as a measure of renal clearance. RESULTS FUR demonstrated a significant functional impairment of the ischemic kidney 8 and 14 days after injury (P < 0.05 vs. baseline), while contralateral non-ischemic kidneys showed no significant changes. In histological analysis, ischemic kidneys exhibited tubular dilatation and cytoplasmic degeneration as signs of hypoxia without any evidence for necrosis. CONCLUSIONS FUR enables the detection of renal dysfunction and longitudinal long-term follow-up examination in the same individual. Our model may facilitate preclinical therapy evaluation for the identification of effective renoprotective therapies.\"\n",

On the basis of this preclinical model, we conditioned 30 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and TBI, to reduce rates of fatal acute GVHD. Patients were enrolled in two sequential groups: cohort 1 received ATG 10 mg/kg in divided doses (days −4 to −1)+200 cGy TBI (n=16), and cohort 2 received ATG (days −10 to −7)+450 cGy TBI (n=14). Median donor blood chimerism for the combined group was 94, 93 and 93% in the first, second and third months after transplant. Only three developed grade II acute GVHD despite 43% of patients receiving unrelated donor transplants. One-year survival was 71±11 and 54±14%, respectively, in recipients of related and unrelated donor SCT. Donor lymphocyte infusions were needed in 12 patients for the management of relapse and for mixed donor–recipient chimerism in 4 patients. We conclude that 10 mg/kg ATG and TBI allows engraftment with a low risk of acute GVHD; however, further dose optimization of ATG is required to achieve a balance between GVHD and disease relapse.\"\n",

      "\"Potential Benefits and Harms of Novel Antidiabetic Drugs During COVID-19 CrisisPatients with diabetes have been reported to have enhanced susceptibility to severe or fatal COVID-19 infections, including a high risk of being admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and septic complications. Given the global prevalence of diabetes, affecting over 450 million people worldwide and still on the rise, the emerging COVID-19 crisis poses a serious threat to an extremely large vulnerable population. However, the broad heterogeneity and complexity of this dysmetabolic condition, with reference to etiologic mechanisms, degree of glycemic derangement and comorbid associations, along with the extensive sexual dimorphism in immune responses, can hamper any patient generalization. Even more relevant, and irrespective of glucose-lowering activities, DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists may have a favorable impact on the modulation of viral entry and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19 infection, although current evidence is limited and not univocal. Conversely, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the likelihood of COVID-19-related ketoacidosis decompensation among patients with severe insulin deficiency. Mindful of their widespread popularity in the management of diabetes, addressing potential benefits and harms of novel antidiabetic drugs to clinical prognosis at the time of a COVID-19 pandemic deserves careful consideration.\"\n",

Fifty-three liver allograft samples from unique HCV LT recipients were studied using microarrays, including a training set (n = 32) and a validation set (n = 19). Two no-HCV-ACR samples from LT recipients were also included. Probe set intensity values were obtained using the robust multiarray average method (RMA) method. Analysis of variance identified statistically differentially expressed genes (P ≤ 0.005). The limma package was used to fit the mixed-effects models using a restricted maximum likelihood procedure. The last absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model was fit with HCVrec versus ACR as the dependent variable predicted. N-fold cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased estimate of generalization error. A total of 179 probe sets were differentially expressed among groups, with 71 exclusive genes between HCVrec and HCV-ACR. No differences were found within ACR group (HCV-ACR vs. no-HCV-ACR). Supervised clustering analysis displayed two clearly independent groups, and no-HCV-ACR clustered within HCV-ACR. HCVrec-related genes were associated with a cytotoxic T-cell profile, and HCV-ACR-related genes were associated with the inflammatory response. The best-fitting LASSO model classifier accuracy, including 15 genes, has an accuracy of 100% in the training set. N-fold cross-validation accuracy was 78.1%, and sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 50.0%, 90.9%, 71.4% and 80.0%, respectively. Arginase type II (ARG2), ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1), transmembrane protein 176A (TMEM176A) and TMEM176B genes were significantly confirmed in the validation set. A molecular signature capable of distinguishing HCVrec and ACR in HCV LT recipients was identified and validated.\"\n",

      "\"A Conceptual Framework for Human–AI Hybrid Adaptivity in EducationEducational AI (AIEd) systems are increasingly designed and evaluated with an awareness of the hybrid nature of adaptivity in real-world educational settings. In practice, beyond being a property of AIEd systems alone, adaptivity is often jointly enacted by AI systems and human facilitators (e.g., teachers or peers). Despite much recent research activity, theoretical and conceptual guidance for the design of such human–AI systems remains limited. In this paper we explore how adaptivity may be shared across AIEd systems and the various human stakeholders who work with them. Based on a comparison of prior frameworks, which tend to examine adaptivity in AIEd systems or human coaches separately, we first synthesize a set of dimensions general enough to capture human–AI hybrid adaptivity. Using these dimensions, we then present a conceptual framework to map distinct ways in which humans and AIEd systems can augment each other’s abilities. Through examples, we illustrate how this framework can be used to characterize prior work and envision new possibilities for human–AI hybrid approaches in education.\"\n",

Thus, emergency nurses' disaster nursing core competencies are essential for coping with disasters. The purpose of the study reported here was to identify factors influencing the disaster nursing core competencies of emergency nurses. Methods A survey was conducted among 231 emergency nurses working in 12 hospitals in South Korea. Data were collected on disaster-related experience, attitude, knowledge, and disaster nursing core competencies by means of a questionnaire. Results In multiple regression analysis, disaster-related experience exerted the strongest influence on disaster nursing core competencies, followed by disaster-related knowledge. The explanatory power of these factors was 25.6%, which was statistically significant (F =12.189, p <0.001). Conclusions These findings indicate that the disaster nursing core competencies of emergency nurses could be improved through education and training programs that enhance their disaster preparedness.

      "\"Use of RT-PCR for diagnosis of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) in carrier sea trout Salmo trutta after experimental infection.The emergence of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) in Canada and Scotland and frequent new outbreaks of the disease in Norway strongly suggest that there are natural reservoirs for the virus. The main host for the ISA virus is probably a fish occurring in the coastal area, most likely a salmonid fish. Since sea trout is an abundant species along the Norwegian coast, common in areas where ISA outbreaks occur, and possibly a life-long carrier of the ISA virus, a study was initiated to evaluate reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for diagnosis of the virus in experimentally infected trout. Several tissues (kidney, spleen, heart and skin) were collected from the trout during a 135 d period. The following diagnostic methods for detection of the ISA virus were compared: cell culture (Atlantic Salmon Kidney, ASK cells), challenge of disease-free salmon with blood from the infected trout, and RT-PCR. The RT-PCR was the most sensitive of these methods. With the help of this technique it was possible to pick out positive individuals throughout the experimental period of 135 d. Challenge of disease-free salmon were more sensitive than cell culture (ASK cells). These 2 latter methods require use of the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) or RT-PCR for verification of presence of ISA virus.\"\n",

Technologies and operator technique have evolved to the point where we may now provide effective endovascular therapy for a spectrum of lesions, patients, and clinical scenarios. Endovascular treatment of this segment offers a significant alternative to surgical revascularization, and may confer improved safety for a wide range of patients, not solely those deemed high surgical risk. Although endovascular therapy of the FP segment has historically been hampered by high rates of restenosis, emerging technologies including drug-eluting stents, drug-coated balloons, and perhaps bio-absorbable stent platforms, provide future hope for more durable patency in complex disease. By combining lessons learned from clinical trials, international trends in clinical practice, and insights regarding emerging technologies, we may appropriately tailor our application of endovascular therapy to provide optimal care to our patients.

      "\"Enhanced Humoral Response to Influenza Vaccine in Aged Mice with A Novel Adjuvant, rOv-ASP-1Immunization is the best way to prevent seasonal epidemics and pandemics of influenza. There are two kinds of influenza vaccines available in the United States: an inactivated vaccine (TIV) and an attenuated vaccine; however, only TIV is approved for immunization of the elderly population. While the aged population has the highest rate of influenza vaccination, the protective efficacy is low as evidenced by elderly individuals having the highest mortality associated with influenza. Recently, we reported that an adjuvant derived from the helminth parasite Onchocerca volvulus, named O. volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1), can significantly enhance the protective efficacy of an inactivated vaccine (TIV) in young adult mice. In the current study, we examined whether this recombinant Ov-ASP-1 (rOv-ASP-1) can enhance the efficacy of TIV in aged mice as well. While primary immunization with TIV alone produced only a low level of influenza-specific antibodies (total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2c) in aged mice, the antibody levels were significantly increased after immunization with TIV+rOv-ASP-1. More importantly, the level of the total IgG in aged mice administered TIV+rOv-ASP-1 was comparable to that of young adult mice immunized with TIV alone. Co-administration of rOv-ASP-1 induced a low level of crossreactive antibody and enhanced the protective efficacy of TIV in aged mice, reflected by significantly increased survival after challenge with a heterologous influenza virus. rOv-ASP-1 was also superior to the conventional adjuvant alum in inducing specific IgG after TIV immunization in aged mice, and in conferring protection after challenge. These results demonstrate that rOv-ASP-1 may serve as a potential adjuvant for influenza vaccine to improve the efficacy of protection in the elderly.\"\n",

Source credibility is among the most important aspects of credibility evaluations. One of the most direct ways to understand source credibility is to use measurements of brain activity of humans who make credibility evaluations. Nevertheless, source credibility has never been investigated using such a method before. This article reports the results of an experiment during which we have measured brain activity during source credibility evaluation using EEG. The experiment allowed for identification of brain areas that were active when a participant made positive or negative source credibility evaluations.

      "\"What is the long term impact of voucher scheme on primary care? Findings from a repeated cross sectional study using propensity score matching.BACKGROUND Vouchers are increasingly used as a demand-side subsidy to reduce financial hardship and improve quality of services. Elderly Healthcare Voucher Scheme has been introduced by the Hong Kong Government since 2009 to provide subsidy to elderly aged 65 and above to visit ten different types of private primary care providers for curative, preventive and chronic disease management. Several enhancements have been made over the past few years. This paper (as part of an evaluation study of this unique healthcare voucher scheme) aims to assess the long term impact of the voucher scheme in encouraging the use of primary care services. METHODS Two rounds of cross-sectional survey among elderly in Hong Kong were conducted in 2010 and 2016. Propensity score matching and analysis were used to compare changes in perception and usage of vouchers over time. RESULTS 61.5% of respondents in 2016 agreed \"the scheme encourages me to use more private primary care services\", a significant increase from 36.2% in 2010. Among those who agreed in 2016, the majority thought the voucher scheme would encourage them to use acute services (90.3%) in the private sector, rather than preventive care (40.3%) and chronic disease management (12.2%). Respondents also reported that their current usual choice of care was visiting \"both public and private doctors\" (61.9%), representing a significant increase (up from 48.4%) prior to their use of voucher. CONCLUSIONS The voucher scheme has encouraged the use of more private care services, particularly acute services rather than disease prevention or management of chronic disease. However, there needs to be caution that the untargeted and open-ended nature of voucher scheme could result in supply-induced demand which would affect long term financial sustainability. The dual utilization of health services in both the public and private sector may also compromise continuity and quality of care. The design of the voucher needs to be more specific, targeting prevention and chronic disease management rather than unspecified care which is mainly acute and episodic in order to maximize service delivery capacity as a whole for equitable access in universal health coverage and to contribute to a sustainable financing system.\"\n",

      "\"Design and Evaluation of a Portable Negative Pressure Hood with HEPA Filtration to Protect Health Care Workers Treating Patients with Transmissible Respiratory InfectionsBACKGROUND: To mitigate potential exposure of healthcare workers (HCWs) to SARS-CoV-2 via aerosol routes, we have developed a portable hood which not only creates a barrier between HCW and patient, but also utilizes negative pressure with filtration of aerosols by a HEPA filter. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The hood has iris-port openings for access to the patient, and an opening large enough for a patient's head and upper torso. The top of the hood is a HEPA filter connected to a blower to apply negative pressure. We determined the aerosol penetration from outside to inside in laboratory experiments. RESULTS: The penetration of particles from within the hood to the breathing zones of HCWs outside the hood was near 10(-4) (0.01%) in the 200-400 nm size range, and near 10(-3) (0.1%) for smaller particles. Penetration values for particles in the 500 nm – 5 μm range were below 10(-2) (1%). Fluorometric analysis of deposited fluorescein particles on the personal protective equipment of a HCW revealed that negative pressure reduces particle deposition both outside and inside the hood. CONCLUSIONS: We find that negative pressure hoods can be effective controls to mitigate aerosol exposure to HCWs, while simultaneously allowing access to patients.\"\n",

RECENT FINDINGS The pathological significance of DPP-4, either dependent or independent on catalytic activities, on renal diseases has been reported in preclinical studies. With regard to this, we have shown that damaged endothelial cells are converted to a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which is associated with the induction of DPP-4 in endothelial cells. The endothelial mesenchymal transition may contribute to kidney fibrosis; indeed, the antifibrotic effects of DPP-4 inhibitors have been reported elsewhere. However, even though such potential benefits of DPP-4 inhibitors on renal diseases were shown in preclinical studies, clinical trials have not yet revealed significant benefits in renal hard outcomes of DPP-4 inhibitors. SUMMARY To completely understand the beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, both the following studies are required: first, preclinical studies that analyze deeper molecular mechanisms of DPP-4 inhibition, and, second, clinical studies that investigate whether such potential beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibitors are relevant to the patients in the clinic.\"\n",

      "\"What Do the Dental Students Know about Infection Control? A Cross-Sectional Study in a Teaching Hospital, Rawalpindi, PakistanBACKGROUND: Dental students are exposed to various infections and infective sources during their training, and on this aspect, their level of knowledge is suboptimal and practices are risky. Therefore, improving their knowledge and practices would contribute significantly to infection control. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the level of understanding of senior dental students regarding the infection control in the dental practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among dental students (3rd year and 4th year) of the Foundation University Dental College, Pakistan. The sample consisted of 100 third year dental students and 88 fourth year students. A self-administrated questionnaire was used for data collection which consisted of fourteen close-ended items. Frequencies of knowledge, attitudes, and practice were calculated separately by using SPSS 21.0 software. RESULTS: Almost half of the students would not use any antiseptic for sterilizing their hands, and only two-third would ask their patient to use an oral mouth rinse before starting the treatment. Many students did not the optimal temperature of the autoclave for sterilization of the instruments. Only one-third would wear the personal protective equipment during a procedure. Around one-third of the study participants reported that ineffective sterilization during clinical practice can transmit infection from one patient to another. CONCLUSION: Knowledge on infection control among the dental students is though weak, practices are not as per standards but attitudes are positive and encouraging for taking steps and complying with measures on infection control.\"\n",

The most prominent of them have been adenoviruses, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, hepatitis C virus, herpesviruses, human immunodeficiency virus of type 1, and picornaviruses. This chapter presents an introductory remark on such viruses, mechanisms of their invasion, and diseases related to them. The inhibition of these viruses is of great concern to human beings. Each of these viruses encodes one or more proteases that play crucial roles in their replication, and thus they are important targets for the design and development of potent antiviral agents. The chapter, therefore, also introduces the readers to such proteases and their structures and functions. This chapter is thus a prelude to the remaining chapters in the book, which present in detail about the different viruses and their proteases.\"\n",

      "\"Analysis of murine hepatitis virus strain A59 temperature-sensitive mutant TS-LA6 suggests that nsp10 plays a critical role in polyprotein processing.Coronaviruses are the largest RNA viruses, and their genomes encode replication machinery capable of efficient replication of both positive- and negative-strand viral RNAs as well as enzymes capable of processing large viral polyproteins into putative replication intermediates and mature proteins. A model described recently by Sawicki et al. (S. G. Sawicki, D. L. Sawicki, D. Younker, Y. Meyer, V. Thiel, H. Stokes, and S. G. Siddell, PLoS Pathog. 1:e39, 2005), based upon complementation studies of known temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59, proposes that an intermediate comprised of nsp4 to nsp10/11 ( approximately 150 kDa) is involved in negative-strand synthesis. Furthermore, the mature forms of nsp4 to nsp10 are thought to serve as cofactors with other replicase proteins to assemble a larger replication complex specifically formed to transcribe positive-strand RNAs. In this study, we introduced a single-amino-acid change (nsp10:Q65E) associated with the TS-LA6 phenotype into nsp10 of the infectious clone of MHV. Growth kinetic studies demonstrated that this mutation was sufficient to generate the TS phenotype at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Our results demonstrate that the TS mutant variant of nsp10 inhibits the main protease, 3CLpro, blocking its function completely at the nonpermissive temperature. These results implicate nsp10 as being a critical factor in the activation of 3CLpro function. We discuss how these findings challenge the current hypothesis that nsp4 to nsp10/11 functions as a single cistron in negative-strand RNA synthesis and analyze recent complementation data in light of these new findings.\"\n",

      "\"Viral etiology of hospitalized acute lower respiratory infections in children under 5 years of age – a systematic review and meta-analysisAIM: To estimate the proportional contribution of influenza viruses (IV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), adenoviruses (AV), and coronaviruses (CV) to the burden of severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI). METHODS: The review of the literature followed PRISMA guidelines. We included studies of hospitalized children aged 0-4 years with confirmed ALRI published between 1995 and 2011. A total of 51 studies were included in the final review, comprising 56 091 hospitalized ALRI episodes. RESULTS: IV was detected in 3.0% (2.2%-4.0%) of all hospitalized ALRI cases, PIV in 2.7% (1.9%-3.7%), and AV in 5.8% (3.4%-9.1%). CV are technically difficult to culture, and they were detected in 4.8% of all hospitalized ALRI patients in one study. When respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and less common viruses were included, at least one virus was detected in 50.4% (40.0%-60.7%) of all hospitalized severe ALRI episodes. Moreover, 21.9% (17.7%-26.4%) of these viral ALRI were mixed, including more than one viral pathogen. Among all severe ALRI with confirmed viral etiology, IV accounted for 7.0% (5.5%-8.7%), PIV for 5.8% (4.1%-7.7%), and AV for 8.8% (5.3%-13.0%). CV was found in 10.6% of virus-positive pneumonia patients in one study. CONCLUSIONS: This article provides the most comprehensive analysis of the contribution of four viral causes to severe ALRI to date. Our results can be used in further cost-effectiveness analyses of vaccine development and implementation for a number of respiratory viruses.\"\n",

      "\"Establishing a model for predicting the outcome of COVID-19 based on combination of laboratory testsINTRODUCTION: There are currently no satisfactory methods for predicting the outcome of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to establish a model for predicting the prognosis of the disease. METHODS: The laboratory results were collected from 54 deceased COVID-19 patients on admission and before death. Another 54 recovered COVID-19 patients were enrolled as control cases. RESULTS: Many laboratory indicators, such as neutrophils, AST, Î³-GT, ALP, LDH, NT-proBNP, Hs-cTnT, PT, APTT, D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, CRP, ferritin and procalcitonin, were all significantly increased in deceased patients compared with recovered patients on admission. In contrast, other indicators such as lymphocytes, platelets, total protein and albumin were significantly decreased in deceased patients on admission. Some indicators such as neutrophils and procalcitonin, others such as lymphocytes and platelets, continuously increased or decreased from admission to death in deceased patients respectively. Using these indicators alone had moderate performance in differentiating between recovered and deceased COVID-19 patients. A model based on combination of four indicators (P = 1/[1 + e-(-2.658+0.587×neutrophils - 2.087×lymphocytes - 0.01×platelets+0.004×IL-2R)]) showed good performance in predicting the death of COVID-19 patients. When cutoff value of 0.572 was used, the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction model were 90.74% and 94.44%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using the current indicators alone is of modest value in differentiating between recovered and deceased COVID-19 patients. A prediction model based on combination of neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and IL-2R shows good performance in predicting the outcome of COVID-19.\"\n",

METHODS Data obtained from 271 consecutive patients (70 men and 201 women; median age 57 years; range 23-79 years) who presented with UIA for coil embolization between July 2011 and June 2013 were analyzed. Two independent reviewers examined the DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient maps obtained the following day for the presence of restrictive diffusion spots and counted the number of spots. Multivariate analysis was then performed to identify independent risk factors for developing microembolism following the coiling of an aneurysm. RESULTS Microembolic lesions were noted in 101 of 271 patients (37.3%). The results of the multivariate analysis showed that the following factors significantly influenced the risk for microembolism: age, diabetes, previous history of ischemic stroke, high-signal FLAIR lesions in the white matter, multiple aneurysms, and the insertion of an Enterprise stent (all ORs > 1.0 and all p values < 0.05). Previously known risk factors such as prolonged procedure duration, aneurysm size, and decreased antiplatelet function did not show any significant influence. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of microembolism after endovascular coiling of UIA was not low. Lesions occurred more frequently in patients with vascular status associated with old age, diabetes, and previous stroke. Aneurysm multiplicity and the type of stent used for treatment also influenced lesion occurrence.\"\n",

      "\"Laryngitis, Tracheitis, Epiglottitis, and Bronchiolitis: Sore Throat, Change in Voice, Feverora Wheezing Infant in Respiratory DistressThe middle and lower respiratory tract is a very common location for infections in infants and children. Infections of the mucosal surfaces of the larynx, trachea, and bronchial tree account for the majority of all infections in this age group and can be associated with considerable morbidity and even mortality in certain populations. Many viral upper respiratory tract pathogens can also involve the middle and lower respiratory tract, particularly for children experiencing their first infection with the pathogen. Laryngitis may cause sore throat and hoarse voice but can also be associated with tracheitis and even bronchiolitis as the pathogen, infection, and host responses move further down the respiratory tree. Bronchiolitis may also occur as a separate infection in the lower airways presenting as respiratory distress in a young infant with prominent wheezing. Many respiratory viral diseases occur with seasonal patterns, with most cases occurring in the fall, winter, and early spring in temperate climates. In the tropics, some viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), may cause disease sporadically, year round, but epidemics still occur during “rainy” seasons. Bacterial infections can also involve the middle airway. Epiglottitis is a feared condition due to the potential for sudden airway obstruction. Fortunately, the diagnosis of epiglottitis has become quite rare since the introduction of routine childhood immunization against Haemophilus influenzae, serotype B, was once the most common cause of epiglottitis. Bacterial tracheitis can be a secondary bacterial infection following an acute viral infection of the trachea or a consequence of prolonged endotracheal intubation. While the mechanism of injury to the trachea is different, both processes lead to disruption of mucosal integrity, predisposing the patient to a tracheal infection caused by bacteria that normally only colonize the airway.\"\n",

      "\"Disease Protection in Sea Coast (and Inland) Cities: Problems in Dense Populations with Shantytowns/SlumsAs discussed earlier in this book, there are sea coast cities worldwide that are at risk from floods, storm surges, and extreme weather conditions such as wind-driven high category hurricanes (typhoons, monsoons), or drought and heat waves, plus along Pacific Ocean coasts, earthquakes and tsunamis. A municipality and its public health services have to be prepared to adapt to their preparations to deal with what contemporary experiences and history reveal are the most likely physical hazards and diseases to impact it. The two main preparatives are first to be able to care for the injured during a hazard event at well-staffed and supplied hospitals and medical clinics or field hospitals. The second is to fill the basic needs of affected populations with clean water, food, shelter, toilets, waste collection, and if necessary power restoration. These primary responses will help to reduce the chance of an onset and spread of disease. It is important to activate search and rescue teams help citizens isolated or trapped by the event that did not or could not evacuate such as in the case of extreme weather and flooding. In addition, where there have been deaths, bodies should be recovered and interred as soon as possible in order to prevent sickness that might originate from them. For instances of collapsed structures with people trapped inside, equipment that can move debris and rescue people or recover the deceased is necessary as would be the case for less common strong earthquakes as well as some extreme storm events. What was just described may be a good template to follow, but in reality, many sea coast cities in developing and less developed countries do not have the resources to cope with severe hazards that might impact them. Here, the World Health Organization and developed nations, large and small, have sent in personnel, supplies, and equipment to help an impacted sea coast city (or inland city) in the past and will surely continue to do so in the future.\"\n",

      "\"Role of Pharmacists in COVID-19 Disease: A Jordanian PerspectiveOBJECTIVES: The novel 2019 coronavirus outbreak that first appeared in Wuhan has quickly gained global attention, due to its high transmissibility and devastating clinical and economic outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the possible roles of Jordanian pharmacists in minimizing the stage of community transmission. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using Google forms targeting Jordanian pharmacists was conducted during March 2020 and distributed electronically by means of social media. Using the survey tool, we measured the pharmacists' knowledge, the educative activities they perform, and their perceptions regarding undertaking traditional and untraditional roles during the COVID-19 outbreak, as specified by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). Collected data were analyzed using SPSS version-19. RESULTS: Jordanian pharmacists (n = 449) reported performing various educative activities, and in general, they were knowledgeable about various aspects of the COVID-19 disease (median knowledge score: 20 [range, 13-25]), but certain gaps in knowledge were detected that must be addressed. Pharmacists had positive perceptions about both their traditional and untraditional roles specified by the FIP, the median perceptions score was 4 (range, 1-5). CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian pharmacists can be used to reduce community transmission of the outbreak. However, more actions are required to keep pharmacists knowledgeable with recent disease updates to enable them to perform their tasks effectively during times of crisis.\"\n",

      "\"Perioperative goal directed therapy using automated closed-loop fluid management: the future?Although surgery has become much safer, it has also becoming increasingly more complex and perioperative complications continue to impact millions of patients worldwide each year. Perioperative hemodynamic optimization utilizing Goal Directed Therapy (GDT) has attracted considerable interest within the last decade due to its ability to improve postoperative short and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing higher risk surgeries. The concept of GDT in this context can be loosely defined as collecting data from minimally invasive hemodynamic monitors with the intention of using such data (flow-related parameters and/or dynamic parameters of fluid responsiveness) to titrate therapeutic interventions (intravenous fluids and/or inotropic therapy administration) with the ultimate aim of optimizing end organ tissue perfusion. Recently, the increasing amount of evidence supporting the implementation of GDT strategies has been considered so robust as to allow for the creation of national recommendations in the United Kingdom (UK), France, and Europe. These recommendations from such influential scientific societies and the potential clinical and economic benefits of GDT protocols need to also be examined within the current shift from a \"pay for service\" to a \"pay for performance\" health care system. This shift is strongly encouraged within emerging systems such as the Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) paradigm from the United States. As a result, hospitals and clinicians around the world have become increasingly incentivized to implement perioperative hemodynamic optimization using GDT strategies within their departments. Unfortunately, its adoption continues to be quite limited and a lack of standardized criteria for perioperative fluid administrations has resulted in significant clinical variability among practitioners. This current review will provide a brief up-to-date overview of GDT, discuss current clinical practice, analyze why implementation has been limited and finally, describe the newer closed-loop GDT concept along with its potential risks and benefits.\"\n",

Individual animals were exposed to a specific dose of airborne pathogen. Following exposure, animals were individually housed and monitored for evidence of infection. The detection of specific antibodies and/or the pathogen in diagnostic specimens was evidence that the exposure dose resulted in infection. If replicated over a range of doses, the results can be used to derive a dose–response curve for a variety of animal species and infectious pathogens. This information is useful in estimating the likelihood of infection associated with exposure to airborne infectious microorganisms. Applications include predicting the risk of transmission associated with exposure to airborne pathogens, modeling the transmission of airborne pathogens, and determining requirements for effective exposure doses for vaccines delivered in aerosols.\"\n",

      "\"Real time detection of farm-level swine mycobacteriosis outbreak using time series modeling of the number of condemned intestines in abattoirsMycobacteriosis in swine is a common zoonosis found in abattoirs during meat inspections, and the veterinary authority is expected to inform the producer for corrective actions when an outbreak is detected. The expected value of the number of condemned carcasses due to mycobacteriosis therefore would be a useful threshold to detect an outbreak, and the present study aims to develop such an expected value through time series modeling. The model was developed using eight years of inspection data (2003 to 2010) obtained at 2 abattoirs of the Higashi-Mokoto Meat Inspection Center, Japan. The resulting model was validated by comparing the predicted time-dependent values for the subsequent 2 years with the actual data for 2 years between 2011 and 2012. For the modeling, at first, periodicities were checked using Fast Fourier Transformation, and the ensemble average profiles for weekly periodicities were calculated. An Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the residual of the ensemble average on the basis of minimum Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). The sum of the ARIMA model and the weekly ensemble average was regarded as the time-dependent expected value. During 2011 and 2012, the number of whole or partial condemned carcasses exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the predicted values 20 times. All of these events were associated with the slaughtering of pigs from three producers with the highest rate of condemnation due to mycobacteriosis.\"\n",

      "\"Type I IFN family members: Similarity, differences and interactionAbstract Interferons (IFN) are key cytokines with multifaceted antiviral and cell-modulatory properties. Three distinct types of IFN are recognized (I–III) based on structural features, receptor usage, cellular source and biological activities. The action of IFNs is mediated by a complex, partially overlapping, transcriptional program initiated by the interaction with specific receptors. Genetic diversity, with polymorphisms and mutations, can modulate the extent of IFN responses and the susceptibility to infections. Almost all viruses developed mechanisms to subvert the IFN response, involving both IFN induction and effector mechanisms. Interactions between IFN types may occur, for both antiviral and cell-modulatory effects, in a complex interplay, involving both synergistic and antagonistic effects. Interferon-associated diseases, not related to virus infections may occur, some of them frequently observed in IFN-treated patients. On the whole, IFNs are pleiotropic biologic response modifiers, that, upon activation of thousands genes, induce a broad spectrum of activities, regulating cell cycle, differentiation, plasma membrane molecules, release of mediators, etc., that can be relevant for cell proliferation, innate and adaptive immunity, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and other body functions.\"\n",

However, there is an ongoing debate on its potential efficacy, especially in the light of region-specific demographics. We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities and fraction of app users in the population. Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can improve containment and achieve successful epidemic mitigation even with relatively small fraction of the population using it, and, with increasing penetrance of its adoption, suppression. However, when regional differences in population density are taken into consideration, the epidemic can be significantly harder to contain in higher density areas, highlighting potential limitations of this intervention in specific contexts. This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draw attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies.\"\n",

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, laboratory characteristics and CT imaging of confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 22 to February 28, 2020 in Huanggang Central Hospital and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University. Real time PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expressions of ACE2 in tissues. RESULTS: Among the 194 patients infected with COVID-19, 108 patients were male, with a median age of 48.3 years. The average preclinical period was 7.44 day. Except for 37 severe or critically ill patients, the rest of the 157 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 190 (97.94%) patients were confirmed during the three times nucleic acid test. The main clinical symptom of the patients were fever, sore throat and cough, which accounted for 146 cases (75.26%), 98 (50.52%) and 86 cases (44.33%), respectively. 30 patients (15.46%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 141 patients (72.68%) showed abnormal density shadow, while 53 cases (27.32%) had no obvious abnormality in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 109 cases have been discharged from the hospital, and 9 patients died. The ACE2 expression levels were up-regulated in patients of severe type and critically ill type. CONCLUSION: Clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and CT imaging should be combined for comprehensive analysis to diagnose COVID-19. ACE2 may be the receptor of COVID-19.

MATERIAL AND RESULTS: Between May 31 and June 15, 2017, 44 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported from 3 simultaneous clusters from 3 health care facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, including 11 fatal cases. Out of the total reported cases, 29 cases were reported from King Saud Medical City. The cluster at King Saud Medical City was ignited by a single superspreader patient who presented with acute renal failure. After 14 hours in the open area of the emergency department and 2 hemodialysis sessions he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV. One hundred twenty contacts who had direct unprotected exposure were screened. Among those contacts, 9 out of 107 health care workers (5 nurses, 3 physicians, and 1 paramedic) and 7 out of 13 patients tested positive for MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: This hospital outbreak demonstrated the difficulties in diagnosing pneumonia in patients with renal and cardiac failure, which leads to delayed suspicion of MERS-CoV and hence delay in applying the proper infection control procedures. In MERS-CoV endemic countries there is an urgent need for developing rapid point-of-care testing that would assist emergency department staff in triaging suspected cases of MERS-CoV to ensure timely isolation and management of their primary illness and prevent major MERS-CoV outbreaks.\"\n",

      "\"Recommendations for standardized management of CML patients in the core epidemic area of COVID-19(Multi-center survey results in Hubei Province, China)Background Since late December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that began in Wuhan, has become endemic in China and more than 100 countries and regions in the world. There is no report about the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients untill now. We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. Methods In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 . Findings Of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. Only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with COVID-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Interpretation While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak. Patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death.\"\n",

      "\"On the evolutionary epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2There is no doubt that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 is mutating and thus has the potential to adapt during the current pandemic. Whether this evolution will lead to changes in the transmission, the duration, or the severity of the disease is not clear. This has led to considerable scientific and media debate, from raising alarms about evolutionary change to dismissing it. Here we review what little is currently known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and extend existing evolutionary theory to consider how selection might be acting upon the virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is currently no definitive evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing further adaptation, continued, evidence-based, analysis of evolutionary change is important so that public health measures can be adjusted in response to substantive changes in the infectivity or severity of COVID-19.\"\n",

      "\"Potential Inhibitors for Novel Coronavirus Protease Identified by Virtual Screening of 606 Million CompoundsThe rapid outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China followed by its spread around the world poses a serious global concern for public health. To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the identification and development of specific antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy. In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 606 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of molecular descriptors relevant for pharmacokinetics to narrow down the number of initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of potential off-target binding, we report a list of 12 purchasable compounds, with binding affinity to the target protease that is predicted to be more favorable than that of the cocrystallized peptidomimetic compound. In order to quickly advise ongoing therapeutic intervention for patients, we evaluated approved antiviral drugs and other protease inhibitors to provide a list of nine compounds for drug repurposing. Furthermore, we identified the natural compounds (-)-taxifolin and rhamnetin as potential inhibitors of Mpro. Rhamnetin is already commercially available in pharmacies.\"\n",

METHODS This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients (aged ≥ 40 years with baseline FEV1 ≤ 65% predicted, FEV1 > 0.50 L, FEV1/FVC ≤ 70%, and ≥ 15 pack-year smoking history) received arformoterol (n = 420) or placebo (n = 421) for 1 year. The primary assessment was time from randomization to respiratory death or first COPD exacerbation-related hospitalization. RESULTS Among 841 patients randomized, 103 had ≥ 1 primary event (9.5% vs 15.0%, for arformoterol vs placebo, respectively). Patients who discontinued treatment for any reason (39.3% vs 49.9%, for arformoterol vs placebo, respectively) were followed for up to 1 year postrandomization to assess for primary events. Fewer patients receiving arformoterol than placebo experienced COPD exacerbation-related hospitalizations (9.0% vs 14.3%, respectively). Twelve patients (2.9%) receiving arformoterol and 10 patients (2.4%) receiving placebo died during the study. Risk for first respiratory serious adverse event was 50% lower with arformoterol than placebo (P = .003). Numerically more patients on arformoterol (13; 3.1%) than placebo (10; 2.4%) experienced cardiac serious adverse events; however, time-to-first cardiac serious adverse event was not significantly different. Improvements in trough FEV1 and FVC were greater with arformoterol (least-squares mean change from baseline vs placebo: 0.051 L, P = .030 and 0.075 L, P = .018, respectively). Significant improvements in quality of life (overall St. George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire and Clinical COPD Questionnaire) were observed with arformoterol vs placebo (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Arformoterol demonstrated an approximately 40% lower risk of respiratory death or COPD exacerbation-related hospitalization over 1 year vs placebo. Arformoterol was well-tolerated and improved lung function vs placebo. TRIAL REGISTRY ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT00909779; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.\"\n",

      "\"Coronavirus induced primary demyelination: indications for the involvement of a humoral immune responseCoronavirus MHV‐JHM infection of rodents can result in demyelinating encephalomyelitis. We analysed histological changes induced by coronavirus MHV‐JHM infection in Lewis rats. Besides an acute disease (AE), chronic panencephalitis (CPE) and subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) were induced. These disease types were differentiated by the incubation period, the localization of lesions, the type of tissue damage and distribution of virus antigen. In AE and CPE, virus antigen was detected in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, whereas in SDE neurons lacked virus antigen. Viral nucleocapsid protein (N) was present in the cytoplasm and the spike protein (S) was displayed on the surface of infected neural cells. However, expression of S protein relative to N protein was severely impaired in SDE lesions. Quantitative analysis of infiltrating inflammatory cells revealed that the number of macrophages and T cells were similar in lesions of AE, CPE and SDE. In contrast to that, SDE lesions contained a significantly higher number of IgG† B cells and plasma cells. In addition active demyelinating SDE lesions displayed an enhanced IgG content and deposits of complement C9. These results indicate that virus induced primary demyelination could be a consequence of antibody mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of cells producing spike protein in the chronic forms of the disease indicates down‐regulation of this protein, possibly mediated by anti‐S antibodies.\"\n",

Classical epidemiological models, the standard for predicting and managing the spread of infectious disease, assume that contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals depend on their relative frequency in the population. The behavioral factors that underpin contact rates are not generally addressed. There is, however, an emerging a class of models that addresses the feedbacks between infectious disease dynamics and the behavioral decisions driving host contact. Referred to as “economic epidemiology” or “epidemiological economics,” the approach explores the determinants of decisions about the number and type of contacts made by individuals, using insights and methods from economics. We show how the approach has the potential both to improve predictions of the course of infectious disease, and to support development of novel approaches to infectious disease management.\"\n",

METHODS Between May 2008 and December 2012, computed tomography (CT)- or ultrasound (US)-guided MWA was performed in 6 patients with 7 cystic renal lesions (range 13.8-27 mm, mean 17.02 mm, SD 8.5 mm) Bosniak category III or IV. The number of treatment sessions, treatment results, lesion size changes and complications were evaluated. Technical success (TS), technical effectiveness (TE), local tumor progression rate (LTPR), cancer-specific survival rate (CSSR) and overall survival rate (OSR) were computed. MAIN FINDINGS TS was 100% (7/7) and TE was 100%; LTPR was 0%; CSSR and OSR were 100%. No major complications were observed. CONCLUSION Our preliminary experience with MWA shows a potential role for US/CT-guided percutaneous MWA in treating Bosniak category III or IV cystic renal lesions, as a safe approach to treat selected patients not suitable for surgery.\"\n",

      "\"Availability of COVID-19 Information From National Plastic Surgery Society Web SitesBACKGROUND: National plastic surgery society web sites are an important source of information for patients, family members, and healthcare professionals. There are currently no standardized recommendations for the information provided on web sites. The aim of this study was to assess the information available on each national plastic surgery society web site on the current pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: A Google search was performed of United Nations member sovereign states to determine whether they had a national plastic surgery society web site and to assess its contents. The presence of COVID-19 information was recorded. Access to contact information, Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram handles were noted. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of sovereign states had plastic surgery society web sites. Twenty-two percent of national society web sites had a specific COVID-19 section. Fourteen (93%) of these 15 web sites had COVID-19-specific guidelines available for health care professionals. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 information provided by national plastic surgery society web sites is sparse. Two-thirds of national plastic surgery societies do not have a web presence. The availability of COVID-19 clinical guidelines and patient information sheets on national plastic surgery society web sites is limited. This study suggests that improvement and increase in COVID-19 information provided by many national plastic surgery society web sites are needed.\"\n",

      "\"CT-Guided Microwave Ablation of Liver Tumors in Anatomically Challenging Locations.PURPOSE To assess the feasibility and outcome of microwave ablation (MWA) of hepatic tumors in anatomically challenging locations. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 94 patients with 174 hepatic tumors referred for CT-guided MWA were included in this retrospective institutional review board-approved study. One hundred and twenty-five tumors (median size 17 mm, range 12-24 mm) with subcapsular location (n = 91) and/or in which a transpleural approach was applied (n = 53) were identified (group 1) and compared to tumors with a central intrahepatic location (group 2; n = 49, median size 19 mm, range 12-23 mm). Technical success, complications and local tumor progression (LTP) were evaluated. Risk factors were analyzed using univariate analysis, logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curves (p < 0.05 deemed significant). RESULTS Technical success was 100% in both groups. In group 1, complications occurred in n = 31 tumors (24.8%; pneumothorax n = 20; hematoma n = 11). Complications occurred significantly less often in group 2 (8.2%; n = 4 (hematoma); p = 0.011). There were no major complications. Transpleural approach and number of capsule punctures were identified as risk factors for complications (all p < 0.05). Median follow-up was 265 days. LTP was comparable between both groups (13.6 vs. 10.2%; p = 0.41). Use of hydrodissection was the only independent factor associated with LTP (p = 0.03, HR 3.29). CONCLUSION CT-guided hepatic MWA of subcapsular tumors and subdiaphragmatic tumors requiring a direct or transpleural approach is feasible with increased minor but not major complications. LTP did not differ significantly between both groups.\"\n",

      "\"Clinical ethics during the Covid-19 pandemic: Missing the trees for the forestThe SARS-CoV2 pandemic has exposed the acute vulnerability of the health systems of countries worldwide. While countries are scrambling to contain the spread of the infection, the focus is largely on infection prevention strategies such as isolation, quarantine, physical distancing, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and country-wide lock-down. Important ethical concerns arise in the context of the public health interventions. However, while focusing on the forest, the population, attention must also be paid to the trees, the individuals who suffer the illness. This article focuses on the ethical conflicts between the largely public health- driven focus of the Covid19 prevention and containment measures versus patient-centred care for those who suffer the illness and the consequent moral distress of healthcare providers. The key argument is for countries to mainstream clinical ethics considerations for care of patients with Covid-19 as well as \"non-Covid-19\" illnesses.

A total of 2813 subjects who participated in surveys in 1999, 2003, and 2007 were selected as the samples. Each subject was followed-up for the period of 9 years. From 1999 to 2007, the proportion of mild and severe polypharmacy cases increased from 41.5% (1999) to 51.3% (2003) and 57.1% (2007), respectively. This study found that the more severe the polypharmacy was, the higher the risk of health care service utilization would be. The Generalized Estimating Equation model of multivariate analysis showed that the incidence rate ratio of medical utilization increased with the severity of polypharmacy, as did the use of advanced medical resources (ie, the number of hospitalizations). In particular, the increase in incidence rate ratio was more significant in 3 aspects: (1) number of pharmacy visits; (2) number of emergency room admissions; and (3) number of hospitalizations. The government should establish policies and guidance for the safe use of medicines to ensure reduced risk for older people.\"\n",

Since the 2019 novel coronavirus has strong transmissibility and progress rapidly. It has caused negative social effects and massive economic damage on a global scale. While there is currently no vaccine or effective drugs. Pulmonary fibrosis is a pulmonary disease with progressive fibrosis, which is the main factor leading to pulmonary dysfunction and quality of life decline in SARS survivors after recovery. Extensive epidemiological, viral immunological, and current clinical evidences support the possibility that pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the major complications in COVID-19 patients. Although there are no reports on the mechanism of COVID-19 inducing pulmonary fibrosis, based on the existing theoretical basis, we focus on the possible mechanism of COVID-19 sustained lung damaging, the key role of abnormal immune mechanism in the initiation and promotion of pulmonary fibrosis, and the corresponding therapeutic measures.\"\n",

Binding constant, number of binding sites, and thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures were measured. Results of fluorescence quenching and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy showed that changes occurred in the microenvironment of tryptophan residues and the molecular conformation of pepsin. Molecular interaction distance and energy-transfer efficiency between pepsin and NIC were determined based on Förster nonradiative energy-transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the binding of NIC inhibited pepsin activity in vitro. All these results indicated that NIC bound to pepsin mainly through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds at a single binding site. In conclusion, this study provided substantial molecular-level evidence that NIC could induce changes in pepsin structure and conformation.\"\n",

      "\"Methods for sampling of airborne viruses.To better understand the underlying mechanisms of aerovirology, accurate sampling of airborne viruses is fundamental. The sampling instruments commonly used in aerobiology have also been used to recover viruses suspended in the air. We reviewed over 100 papers to evaluate the methods currently used for viral aerosol sampling. Differentiating infections caused by direct contact from those caused by airborne dissemination can be a very demanding task given the wide variety of sources of viral aerosols. While epidemiological data can help to determine the source of the contamination, direct data obtained from air samples can provide very useful information for risk assessment purposes. Many types of samplers have been used over the years, including liquid impingers, solid impactors, filters, electrostatic precipitators, and many others. The efficiencies of these samplers depend on a variety of environmental and methodological factors that can affect the integrity of the virus structure. The aerodynamic size distribution of the aerosol also has a direct effect on sampler efficiency. Viral aerosols can be studied under controlled laboratory conditions, using biological or nonbiological tracers and surrogate viruses, which are also discussed in this review. Lastly, general recommendations are made regarding future studies on the sampling of airborne viruses.\"\n",

      "\"Proteomic analysis of Rickettsia akari proposes a 44 kDa-OMP as a potential biomarker for Rickettsialpox diagnosisBACKGROUND: Rickettsialpox is a febrile illness caused by the mite-borne pathogen Rickettsia akari. Several cases of this disease are reported worldwide annually. Nevertheless, the relationship between the immunogenicity of R. akari and disease development is still poorly understood. Thus, misdiagnosis is frequent. Our study is aiming to identify immunogenic proteins that may improve disease recognition and enhance subsequent treatment. To achieve this goal, two proteomics methodologies were applied, followed by immunoblot confirmation. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixteen unique proteins were identified in the whole-cell extract of R. akari. The most represented protein groups were found to be those involved in translation, post-translational modifications, energy production, and cell wall development. A significant number of proteins belonged to amino acid transport and intracellular trafficking. Also, some proteins affecting the virulence were detected. In silico analysis of membrane enriched proteins revealed 25 putative outer membrane proteins containing beta-barrel structure and 11 proteins having a secretion signal peptide sequence. Using rabbit and human sera, various immunoreactive proteins were identified from which the 44 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GP63) has demonstrated a unique detection capability. It positively distinguished the sera of patients with Rickettsialpox from other rickettsiae positive human sera. CONCLUSION: Our proteomic analysis certainly contributed to the lack of knowledge of R. akari pathogenesis. The result obtained may also serve as a guideline for a more accurate diagnosis of rickettsial diseases. The identified 44 kDa uncharacterized protein can be certainly used as a unique marker of rickettsialpox or as a target molecule for the development of more effective treatment.\"\n",

      "\"RNase E-dependent degradation of tnaA mRNA encoding tryptophanase is prerequisite for the induction of acid resistance in Escherichia coli.Acid-resistance systems are essential for pathogenic Escherichia coli to survive in the strongly acidic environment of the human stomach (pH < 2.5). Among these, the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) system is the most effective. However, the precise mechanism of GAD induction is unknown. We previously reported that a tolC mutant lacking the TolC outer membrane channel was defective in GAD induction. Here, we show that indole, a substrate of TolC-dependent efflux pumps and produced by the tryptophanase encoded by the tnaA gene, negatively regulates GAD expression. GAD expression was restored by deleting tnaA in the tolC mutant; in wild-type E. coli, it was suppressed by adding indole to the growth medium. RNA-sequencing revealed that tnaA mRNA levels drastically decreased upon exposure to moderately acidic conditions (pH 5.5). This decrease was suppressed by RNase E deficiency. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the RNase E-dependent degradation of tnaA mRNA is accelerated upon acid exposure, which decreases intracellular indole concentrations and triggers GAD induction.\"\n",

Virol. 148 (2003) 1275–1300]. In contrast, the non-cytopathogenic parent virus HM175 clone 1 had no effect on rRNA integrity. We present here data showing that rRNA degradation is followed by apoptosis accompanied by characteristic DNA laddering in the cytoplasm of 18f infected cells. The DNA laddering coincided with the detection of caspase 3 and PARP-1 cleavage and was dependent upon activation of the caspase pathway, since treatment with Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, inhibited both events. RNase L mRNA was present in both virus-infected and uninfected cells. Messenger RNA for the interferon inducible enzyme 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase (2′–5′ OAS), which polymerizes ATP into 2′–5′ oligo adenylate (2–5A, the activator of RNase L) in the presence of double-stranded RNA, was not detected following virus infection. 2′–5′ OAS mRNA was induced by treatment of the cells with interferon-β (IFN-β). IFN-β mRNA was marginally induced following infection. However, phosphorylated STAT 1, a key regulator of interferon-stimulated gene transcription was not detected in virus infected cells. STAT 1 phosphorylation in response to IFN treatment was lower in virus-infected cells, compared to uninfected cells treated with interferon, suggesting that 18f virus infection interferes with interferon signaling. The results suggest that 18f infection causes the induction of a 2–5A independent RNase L like activity.\"\n",

Cattle have been shown to be the main viral reservoir and mounting evidence indicates that infection with influenza D may contribute to the development of bovine respiratory disease. The virus has been detected across the United States, Europe and Asia. To date, influenza D has not been reported in the UK. During the winter and spring of 2017/2018, we performed molecular testing of cattle submitted for post‐mortem examination where respiratory disease signs were present. We detected influenza D virus in 8.7% of cases, often as the sole viral agent and always in conjunction with bacterial co‐infection with one or more agents. Viral RNA was present in both the upper and lower respiratory tract and pathological changes in lung tissues were observed alongside signs of concurrent bacterial infections. Sequencing of one UK isolate revealed that it is similar to viruses from the Republic of Ireland and Italy.\"\n",

In addition to basic statistical properties based on the distribution of interarrival times of packets, actual network traffic exhibits correlations over a wide range of time scales associated with long-range dependence (LRD). This article focuses on examining the impact of both LRD and number of nodes that transmit packets in a typical IoT wireless local network, on performance of the backhaul link. The analysis of latency and packet loss led to an interesting observation that the aggregation of packet streams, originating from single nodes, lowers the importance of LRD, even causing an underestimation of performance results when compared to the queueing system with Markovian input.\"\n",

METHODS The clinical data of patients with COVID-19 admitted in the Infectious Diseases Branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China from January 22nd, 2020 to March 8th, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. According to whether there were gastrointestinal symptoms (poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea), all patients were divided into gastrointestinal symptom group and asymptomatic group. The characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were counted and analyzed, and the correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and gender, age, basic diseases, disease severity, laboratory examination and drug treatment were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 80 COVID-19 patients were involved, 43 cases (53.8%) presented with poor appetite, 17 cases (21.3%) had nausea and vomiting, and 33 cases (41.3%) had diarrhea. Among them, 5 cases, 1 case and 4 cases respectively preformed poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea before admission, while the others experienced gastrointestinal symptoms within 48 hours after admission. Duration of poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea (days) of all patients were 5.3±2.1, 2.2±1.0 and 1.4±0.9, respectively. The patients with poor appetite were older than those without symptoms (years old: 48.2±17.6 vs. 39.3±15.1), albumin (Alb) level and the lymphocytes ratio were lower than those in asymptomatic group [Alb (g/L): 39.8 (35.7, 45.1) vs. 46.1 (42.6, 49.4), lymphocytes ratio: 0.19 (0.09, 0.28) vs. 0.28 (0.17, 0.35)], while the neutrophil ratio, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were higher than those in asymptomatic group [the neutrophil ratio: 0.74 (0.61, 0.85) vs. 0.64 (0.52, 0.76), CRP (mg/L): 21.4 (3.9, 52.9) vs. 5.6 (2.4, 14.0), D-dimer (mg/L): 0.2 (0.2, 0.5) vs. 0.2 (0.1, 0.3), LDH (μmol×s-1×L-1): 4.49 (3.59, 5.19) vs. 3.12 (2.77, 4.90)]; at the same time, more traditional Chinese medicine was used in the patients with gastrointestinal symptoms [65.1% (28/43) vs. 40.5% (15/37), all P < 0.05]. In addition, 14 cases of 18 patients with cardiovascular diseases presented with poor appetite, 7 patients had nausea and vomiting symptoms. All of the 3 patients with chronic kidney disease presented with poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, and 2 of them had diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS The gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are common. Whether it is caused by the virus or related drugs, diet and mental conditions, clinicians should analyze the causes of these symptoms timely, and then provide a better treatment for patients with COVID-19.\"\n",

      "\"Successful containment of Covid‐19 outbreak in a large maternity and perinatal center while continuing clinical serviceWith increasing number of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections and COVID‐19 patients to be taken care of by the health system, more and more health workers become affected by the disease. It has been reported that right from the beginning of the outbreak in Lombardy up to 20% of the doctors and nurses became infected. Under these circumstances, the regular operation of health institutions already suffering from a shortage of staff becomes difficult. This has led to complete or partial shutdowns of hospitals, either due to a lack of uninfected personnel or because of uncontrollable chains of infection endangering patients. In one of the largest university perinatal center in Bavaria with more than 3000 births per year, an outbreak of COVID‐19 occurred in March 2020, affecting 36 staff members, including doctors, nurses, and midwives. Here, we describe the outbreak and present the measures contributing to the successful containment of the outbreak within three weeks. At the same time, clinical services could be maintained, however, not without deployment of personnel exposed to employees infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Apart from massive testing of personnel in pre‐defined phases and increased hygiene measures, including a general obligation to wear surgical face masks, we identified the need to monitor cases of illness across all groups of employees, to ensure social distancing within personnel and to evaluate contacts of clinical personnel outside of the hospital environment, in order to be able to interpret chains of infections and to disrupt them. Overall, only a bundle of measures is needed to contain such an outbreak.\"\n",

      "\"What Role Is There for Antithymocyte Globulin in Allogeneic Nonmyeloablative Canine Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation?We investigated whether pretransplantation immunosuppression with canine-specific rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG), combined with a suboptimal dose of 1 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI), would permit engraftment of canine dog leukocyte antigen-identical marrow. Cumulative ATG doses of 2 to 5 mg/kg produced a T-cell depletion of 1 log in the peripheral blood and 50% in the lymph nodes. Serum levels of ATG peaked on days 4 to 6 after initiation of therapy and became undetectable by day 13 as a result of canine antibody responses to ATG. ATG prolonged allogeneic skin graft survival to 14 days (n = 5), compared with 8 days in control dogs (P = .0003). Five dogs were given marrow transplants after ATG (3.5–5 mg/kg) and 1 Gy of TBI. Posttransplantation immunosuppression consisted of mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. All dogs showed initial engraftment, with maximum donor chimerism levels of 25%. However, only 1 dog achieved sustained engraftment, and 4 rejected their grafts. The duration of engraftment ranged from 8 to ≥36 weeks (median, 11 weeks), and this is comparable to that in 6 historical controls not given ATG (range, 3–12 weeks; median, 10 weeks; P = .20). The total nucleated cell doses in the marrow grafts had the highest correlation coefficient with the duration of engraftment: 0.82 (P = .09). We concluded that administering ATG before an otherwise suboptimal conditioning dose of 1 Gy of TBI failed to secure uniform stable hematopoietic engraftment.\"\n",

Elevated total serum IgE levels occurred in seven patients on day +28 after HSCT. This elevation did not coincide with allergy symptoms. ECP showed no correlation with total allergy symptoms, eosinophilia, IgE levels, or pulmonary complications. There was a significant correlation (p = 0.0367) between ECP levels on day +28 and concurrent acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).

It has now been clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV‑2 resides in the upper airways and transmits easily via aerosols and droplets, which significantly increases the risk of infection when performing upper airway procedures. Ventilated COVID-19 patients in a critical condition in the intensive care unit may require tracheotomy for long-term ventilation and to improve weaning. However, the risk of secondary infection of medical personnel performing subsequent tracheostomy care remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the risk of droplet dispersion during tracheostomy tube change and overview tracheostomy tube change in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature was reviewed, quantitative and qualitative analyses of droplet formation during tracheostomy tube change in n = 8 patients were performed, and an overview of and checklist for tracheostomy tube change were compiled. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that tracheostomy tube change, in particular insertion of the new tube, may cause significant droplet formation. The aerosolization of particles smaller than 5 µm was not analyzed. CONCLUSION: Our data, together with the current literature, clearly emphasize that tracheostomy care is associated with a high infection risk and should only be performed by a small group of well-trained, maximally protected healthcare personnel.\"\n",

      "\"Vitrification after multiple rounds of sample application and blotting improves particle density on cryo-electron microscopy gridsSingle particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is becoming widely adopted as a tool for structural characterization of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. Vitrification of the sample to obtain a dense distribution of particles within a single field of view remains a major bottleneck for the success of such experiments. Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective method to increase the density of frozen-hydrated particles on grids with holey carbon support films. It relies on performing multiple rounds of sample application and blotting prior to plunge freezing in liquid ethane. We show that this approach is generally applicable and significantly increases particle density for a range of samples, such as small protein complexes, viruses and filamentous assemblies. The method is versatile, easy to implement, minimizes sample requirements and can enable characterization of samples that would otherwise resist structural studies using single particle cryoEM.\"\n",

      "\"Risk factors for severity and mortality in adult COVID-19 inpatients in WuhanAbstract Background In December 2019, COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Wuhan. Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. Objective The severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were evaluated. Methods Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. Results We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Elder age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a), and high LDH level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 patients was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period. Survival analysis revealed that male, elder age, leukocytosis, high LDH level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19. Conclusions Patients with elder age, hypertension, and high LDH level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19. Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have high risk of death.\"\n",

      "\"Fusion imaging with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for evaluating the early therapeutic efficacy of radiofrequency ablation for small hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas with iso-echoic or unclear margins on conventional ultrasonography.PURPOSE We evaluated the efficacy of fusion imaging combining contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) images and arterial phase contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) or hepatobiliary phase magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (EOB-MRI) images for the early evaluation of the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for small hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with iso-echoic or unclear margins on conventional US. METHODS Forty HCCs (22 iso-echoic and 18 unclear margin lesions) with mean diameters of 13.7 mm were treated using RFA under the guidance of fusion imaging with CEUS. The adequacy of RFA was evaluated using fusion imaging with CEUS 1 day after RFA. CECT or EOB-MRI was performed 1 month after RFA. We reviewed the images obtained using both modalities. RESULTS When the 1-month CECT or EOB-MRI scans were used as the reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 1-day fusion imaging for the diagnosis of the adequate ablation of these HCCs were 97, 100, and 98%, respectively; the kappa value for the agreement between the findings using the two modalities was 0.655. CONCLUSION Fusion imaging with CEUS appears to be a useful method for the early evaluation of the efficacy of RFA for the treatment of HCCs with iso-echoic or unclear margins on conventional US.\"\n",

With this aim, the environmental impacts are mainly related to i) the virus persistence in sewage and wastewaters, and ii) possible fate in aquatic compartments of drugs tested and administered to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Because SARS-CoV-2 spread is very recent, and there is a lack of specific studies on this strain, the virus persistence in wastewaters, the parameters influencing the persistence, as well as the detection methodologies are referenced to the general coronaviruses group. However, the present detailed report of up-to-date knowledge on this topic can provide a useful source for further studies focusing on more deepened investigations of SARS-CoV-2 behaviour in the environment.

      "\"Expression of 9-O- and 7,9-O-acetyl modified sialic acid in cells and their effects on influenza virusesSialic acids (Sia) are widely displayed on the surfaces of cells and tissues. Sia come in a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the C7, C8, and C9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. As Sia or their variant forms are receptors for influenza A and influenza C viruses, we examined the effects of these modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and canines. While they were expressed on the cell surface of canine MDCK cell lines, they were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1-2% of total Sia in these cell lines. We knocked out and over-expressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene (CasD1), and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl Sia expression, confirming previous reports. However, over-expression of CasD1 and knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these modifications. These modifications were essential for influenza C infection, but had no obvious effect on influenza A infection. Sialic acids are key glycans that are involved in many different normal cellular functions, as well as being receptors for many pathogens. However, Sia come in diverse chemically modified forms. Here we examined and manipulated the expression of 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl modified Sia on cells commonly used in influenza virus and other research by engineering the enzymes that produce or remove the acetyl groups.\"\n",

      "\"Glycosaminoglycan binding motif at S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site on spike glycoprotein may facilitate novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) host cell entrySevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic and continues to spread around the globe at an unprecedented rate. To date, no effective therapeutic is available to fight its associated disease, COVID-19. Our discovery of a novel insertion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding motif at S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site (681-686 (PRRARS)) and two other GAG-binding-like motifs within SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP) led us to hypothesize that host cell surface GAGs might be involved in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike more tightly bind to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively). In competitive binding studies, the IC50 of heparin, tri-sulfated non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate, and non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin against SARS-CoV-2 SGP binding to immobilized heparin were 0.056 μM, 0.12 μM, and 26.4 μM, respectively. Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation. Our study augments our knowledge in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and advances carbohydrate-based COVID-19 therapeutic development.\"\n",

To address MDD heterogeneity, factors (severity of psychic depression, motivation, anxiety, psychosis, and sleep disturbance) were also used as outcomes. A multisite, multimodal imaging (diffusion MRI [dMRI] and structural MRI [sMRI]) cohort (52 controls and 147 MDD patients) and several modeling techniques-penalized logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM)-were used. An additional cohort (25 controls and 83 MDD patients) was used for validation. The optimally performing classifier (SVM) had a 26.0% misclassification rate (binary), 52.2 ± 1.69% accuracy (ordinal) and r = .36 correlation coefficient (p < .001, continuous). Using SVM, R2 values for prediction of any MDD factors were <10%. Binary classification in the external data set resulted in 87.95% sensitivity and 32.00% specificity. Though observed classification rates are too low for clinical utility, four image-based features contributed to accuracy across all models and analyses-two dMRI-based measures (average fractional anisotropy in the right cuneus and left insula) and two sMRI-based measures (asymmetry in the volume of the pars triangularis and the cerebellum) and may serve as a priori regions for future analyses. The poor accuracy of classification and predictive results found here reflects current equivocal findings and sheds light on challenges of using these modalities for MDD biomarker identification. Further, this study suggests a paradigm (e.g., multiple classifier evaluation with external validation) for future studies to avoid nongeneralizable results.\"\n",

The optimal treatment strategy for this population is not known. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and EBM Reviews-NHS Economic Evaluation Database were searched from inception until July 2019. A systematic review and narrative summary was performed of RCTs comparing observation or ART versus cALND in clinically node-negative female breast cancer patients with positive SNs. The Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs was used to assess risk of bias. Outcomes of interest included overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), axillary recurrence, and axillary surgery-related morbidity. RESULTS Three trials compared observation with cALND, and two trials compared ART with cALND. No studies blinded participants or personnel, and there was heterogeneity in inclusion criteria, study design, and follow-up. Neither observation nor ART resulted in statistically inferior 5- or 8-year OS or DFS compared with cALND. There was also no statistically significant increase in axillary recurrences associated with either approach. Four trials reported morbidity outcomes, and all showed cALND was associated with significantly more lymphedema, paresthesia, and shoulder dysfunction compared with observation or ART. CONCLUSIONS Women with clinically node-negative breast cancer and positive SNs can safely be managed without cALND.\"\n",

      "\"Profile of Kawasaki disease in children referred to two pediatric rheumatology services in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.OBJECTIVES To describe a population of children diagnosed with Kawasaki's disease (KD) in pediatric rheumatology centers of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, defining the magnitude of the delay period in diagnosing KD and initiating treatment due to confusion with common childhood febrile illnesses and the impact of this delay on the frequency of coronary sequels. METHODS Data analysis from hospital records summarized in a dedicated form, including name, gender, age, date of first recorded clinical signs, date of admission to the specialty service, information about symptoms, clinical evolution, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) use and coronary sequels. RESULTS Of 125 patients, 63% were males. 40% were under 2 years at diagnosis. Average lapse between earliest signs and KD diagnosis was 12 days (mean fever duration, 14 d). Only 22.4% had a diagnosis of KD before entering the specialty service. For the remainder, initial hipotheses included: bacterial (60%) and viral infections (12%), rheumatological diseases (4%) and adverse vaccination reactions (1.6%). Hence, prevalent febrile illnesses of childhood were major confounding factors. For records (85.6%) mentioning treatment, 46.7% reported IVIG treatment, beginning after day 10 in 23 cases (21.5%). 20 patients (16%) presented coronary sequels, 9 of which were diagnosed late, including 3 given IVIG after day 10, and 6 given no IVIG. We found no significant association between the frequency of coronary sequels and: a) sex; b) age; c) clinical criteria; d) initiation of IVIG treatment (before or after day 10). CONCLUSIONS Common febrile illnesses of childhood often confound the diagnosis of KD.\"\n",

      "\"The relationship between respiratory viral loads and diagnosis in children presenting to a pediatric hospital emergency department.BACKGROUND respiratory viral infections account for a considerable proportion of pediatric emergency room visits. Illnesses range in severity from mild upper respiratory tract infections to serious lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). The relationship between viral load and specific viruses to clinical diagnosis made by physicians in this setting is poorly understood. METHODS we applied a real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) panel for 13 common respiratory viruses to 195 frozen, archival nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens obtained from symptomatic children ≤ 4 months of age presenting to the emergency room. Mean total viral load and number of viruses per archival nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen were compared between LRTI (n = 70) and non-LRTI (1 or more of upper respiratory tract infection, fever, or cough) (n = 125), as were yield and concordance of qPCR results to viral culture/direct fluorescence assay (DFA). RESULTS children with LRTI had significantly increased total viral load and harbored more viruses than the non-LRTI group. Respiratory syncytial virus-A and -B were significantly associated with LRTI, and parainfluenza virus-1 with non-LRTI. Individual loads of parainfluenza virus-2 and human rhinovirus were increased in LRTI versus non-LRTI. Quantitative PCR yielded more viruses (including coinfections, where a \"dominant virus\" was typically identified) than viral culture/DFA and documented nucleic acid from pathogens not tested by culture/DFA including human rhinovirus; coronaviruses -OC43, -229E, and -NL63; and metapneumovirus. CONCLUSIONS in symptomatic children presenting to the emergency room, total viral load is related to clinical diagnosis; specific viruses are associated with particular clinical diagnoses, and qPCR has a higher yield than other viral diagnostic methods.\"\n",

      "\"The Efficacy and Safety of Fecal Microbiota Transplant for Recurrent Clostridiumdifficile Infection: Current Understanding and Gap AnalysisThe leading risk factor for Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) is broad-spectrum antibiotics, which lead to low microbial diversity, or dysbiosis. Current therapeutic strategies for CDI are insufficient, as they do not address the key role of the microbiome in preventing C. difficile spore germination into toxin-producing vegetative bacteria, which leads to symptomatic disease. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) appears to reduce the risk of recurrent CDI through microbiome restoration. However, a wide range of efficacy rates have been reported, and few placebo-controlled trials have been conducted, limiting our understanding of FMT efficacy and safety. We discuss the current knowledge gaps driven by questions around the quality and consistency of clinical trial results, patient selection, diagnostic methodologies, use of suppressive antibiotic therapy, and methods for adverse event reporting. We provide specific recommendations for future trial designs of FMT to provide improved quality of the clinical evidence to better inform treatment guidelines.\"\n",

      "\"Safety and efficacy of a novel linear staple device with bioabsorbable polyglicolic acid felt in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic surgery is widely used for the treatment of colorectal cancer, but it is often associated with postoperative anastomotic complications. Generally, gastrointestinal anastomosis for colorectal surgery is performed using mechanical anastomosis with a double stapling technique. Using the automatic suture device with bioabsorbable polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt is expected to adequately reinforce staple lines on fragile tissue, helping to prevent anastomotic complications, including leakage. METHODS This study included 17 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The rectosigmoidal colon was resected toward the dentate line with a novel automatic PGA-felt suture device. RESULTS None of the patients had any postoperative bleeding, and none developed grade III or higher postoperative complications based on the Clavien-Dindo classification. When the sigmoid colon, rectosigmoid, or rectum was anastomosed, holding the excess portion of the PGA felt, stapled with the automatic PGA-felt suture device, allowed us to adequately maneuver the part of the colon or rectum to be anastomosed. With this technique, we could easily and safely insert and remove the automatic anastomotic device. When the lower rectum was resected in a planned, two-step operation, the orientation of the PGA felt helped to determine the direction in which the automatic suture device was to be inserted in the second step. Thus, the resected rectum could easily be stapled in a straight line. CONCLUSION The automatic PGA-felt suture device is safe and effective for colorectal resections and anastomoses.\"\n",

      "\"Japanese citizens' behavioral changes and preparedness against COVID-19: An online survey during the early phase of the pandemicThe Japanese government instituted countermeasures against COVID-19, a pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, in January 2020. Seeking “people’s behavioral changes,” in which the government called on the public to take precautionary measures or exercise self-restraint, was one of the important strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under circumstances in which the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years, were recruited. About 85 percent reported practising the social distancing measures recommended by the government including more females than males and more older than younger participants. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all participants, 92 percent of female, and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23 percent). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60 percent of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50 percent. However, the results also showed that about 20 percent of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures. The statistical analysis indicated that the typical characteristics of those people were male, younger (under 30 years old), unmarried, from lower-income households, a drinking or smoking habit, and a higher extraversion score. To prevent the spread of infection in Japan, it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioural changes using various means to reach and influence them.\"\n",

      "\"Rationale for targeting complement in COVID-19A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged in China and spread internationally, posing a health emergency to the global community. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an acute respiratory illness that varies from mild to the life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The complement system is part of the innate immune arsenal against pathogens, in which many viruses can evade or employ to mediate cell entry. The immunopathology and acute lung injury orchestrated through the influx of pro-inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils can be directly activated by complement components to prime an overzealous cytokine storm. The manifestations of severe COVID-19 such as the ARDS, sepsis and multiorgan failure have an established relationship with activation of the complement cascade. We have collected evidence from all the current studies we are aware of on SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis and the preceding literature on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection linking severe COVID-19 disease directly with dysfunction of the complement pathways. This information lends support for a therapeutic anti-inflammatory strategy against complement, where a number of clinically ready potential therapeutic agents are available.\"\n",

In this study, a variant PEDV strain YN1 was isolated, serially propagated on the Vero cells and was characterized for 200 passages. To better elucidate the molecular basis of Vero cell adaptation of variant PEDV strains, we sequenced, compared, and analyzed the full-genome sequences of parental YN1 and passages 15, 30, 60, 90, 144, and 200. The results showed that the variations increased with the viral passage. The nucleotides sequences of non-structural protein (NSP)2, NSP4-7, NSP10, NSP12 and NSP13 genes did not change during the Vero cell adaptation process. After comparison of the variation characteristic of classical, variant virulent/attenuated strains, it was found that attenuation of PEDV virus was associated with 9−26 amino acid (aa) changes in open reading frames (ORF) 1a/b and S protein, early termination in ORF3, 1–3 aa changes in E, M and N protein and some nucleotide sequences’ synonymous mutations. The aa deletion at about 144 aa of S protein could be the attenuation marker for the PEDV. The pig study showed that the early termination in ORF3 was more important for virus cell adaptation than virus attenuation.\"\n",

In this review, available types of LAMP techniques will be discussed together with their applications in detection of various micro‐organisms. Up to date, there are varieties of LAMP detection methods available including colorimetric and fluorescent detection, real‐time monitoring using turbidity metre and detection using lateral flow device which will also be highlighted in this review. Apart from that, commercialization of LAMP technique had also been reported such as lyophilized form of LAMP reagents kit and LAMP primer sets for detection of pathogenic micro‐organisms.

      "\"The prospect of pandemic influenza: Why should the optometrist be concerned about a public health problem?Abstract Background Optometrists are uniquely placed in the health care field because they provide both services as well as goods to patients. In the event of an influenza pandemic, optometrists may be challenged with a host of issues, including impediments to clinical patient care, manufacture and delivery of ophthalmic devices, and maintaining business continuity and infection control. Overview This report reviews pandemic influenza, the effect of a pandemic event on business survival, and response measures for the primary eye care provider. The ethical and legal issues surrounding control of a pandemic influenza and the prospect of telemedicine as a form of social distancing are also discussed. Conclusions Knowledge of the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures to control a pandemic influenza will help prepare the eye care provider for addressing challenges to patient care and business continuity in the face of a highly contagious disease. Understanding the legal and ethical issues that arise during a pandemic event will help optometrists make informed choices as health care professionals and as citizens.\"\n",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), plays a protective role in pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Here, we showed that ACE2 protein levels were significantly downregulated after infection with H1N1 viruses but was dispensable for viral replication. ACE2 protein downregulation was most likely related to ACE2 protein degradation by proteasome pathway rather than ACE2 shedding. Finally, we found that ACE2 cleavage could be regulated by influenza neuraminidase (NA), which was fundamentally different from the classically sheddase-induced proteolytic cleavage of ACE2.\"\n",

      "\"Federated Learning's Blessing: FedAvg has Linear SpeedupFederated learning (FL) learns a model jointly from a set of participating devices without sharing each other's privately held data. The characteristics of non-iid data across the network, low device participation, and the mandate that data remain private bring challenges in understanding the convergence of FL algorithms, particularly in regards to how convergence scales with the number of participating devices. In this paper, we focus on Federated Averaging (FedAvg)--the most widely used and effective FL algorithm in use today--and provide a comprehensive study of its convergence rate. Although FedAvg has recently been studied by an emerging line of literature, it remains open as to how FedAvg's convergence scales with the number of participating devices in the FL setting--a crucial question whose answer would shed light on the performance of FedAvg in large FL systems. We fill this gap by establishing convergence guarantees for FedAvg under three classes of problems: strongly convex smooth, convex smooth, and overparameterized strongly convex smooth problems. We show that FedAvg enjoys linear speedup in each case, although with different convergence rates. For each class, we also characterize the corresponding convergence rates for the Nesterov accelerated FedAvg algorithm in the FL setting: to the best of our knowledge, these are the first linear speedup guarantees for FedAvg when Nesterov acceleration is used. To accelerate FedAvg, we also design a new momentum-based FL algorithm that further improves the convergence rate in overparameterized linear regression problems. Empirical studies of the algorithms in various settings have supported our theoretical results.\"\n",

      "\"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pregnancy: what obstetricians need to knowCoronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019's effects during pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of â¼5 days (range, 2-14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49-56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54-73%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17-29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be â¼1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks' gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).\"\n",

      "\"C19-TraNet: an empirical, global index-case transmission network of SARS-CoV-2Originating in Wuhan, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has astonished health-care systems across globe due to its rapid and simultaneous spread to the neighboring and distantly located countries. To gain the systems level understanding of the role of global transmission routes in the COVID-19 spread, in this study, we have developed the first, empirical, global, index-case transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 termed as C19-TraNet. We manually curated the travel history of country wise index-cases using government press releases, their official social media handles and online news reports to construct this C19-TraNet that is a spatio-temporal, sparse, growing network comprising of 187 nodes and 199 edges and follows a power-law degree distribution. To model the growing C19-TraNet, a novel stochastic scale free (SSF) algorithm is proposed that accounts for stochastic addition of both nodes as well as edges at each time step. A peculiar connectivity pattern in C19-TraNet is observed, characterized by a fourth degree polynomial growth curve, that significantly diverges from the average random connectivity pattern obtained from an ensemble of its 1,000 SSF realizations. Partitioning the C19-TraNet, using edge betweenness, it is found that most of the large communities are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of countries belonging to different world regions suggesting that there are no spatial constraints on the spread of disease. This work characterizes the superspreaders that have very quickly transported the virus, through multiple transmission routes, to long range geographical locations alongwith their local neighborhoods.\"\n",

      "\"Evolution of ARDS biomarkers: Will metabolomics be the answer?To date, there is no clinically agreed-upon diagnostic test for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): the condition is still diagnosed on the basis of a constellation of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and radiological images. Development of ARDS biomarkers has been in a state of continuous flux during the past four decades. To address ARDS heterogeneity, several studies have recently focused on subphenotyping the disease on the basis of observable clinical characteristics and associated blood biomarkers. However, the strong correlation between identified biomarkers and ARDS subphenotypes has yet to establish etiology; hence, there is a need for the adoption of other methodologies for studying ARDS. In this review, we will shed light on ARDS metabolomics research in the literature and discuss advances and major obstacles encountered in ARDS metabolomics research. Generally, the ARDS metabolomics studies focused on identification of differentiating metabolites for diagnosing ARDS, but they were performed to different standards in terms of sample size, selection of control cohort, type of specimens collected, and measuring technique utilized. Virtually none of these studies have been properly validated to identify true metabolomics biomarkers of ARDS. Though in their infancy, metabolomics studies exhibit promise to unfold the biological processes underlying ARDS and, in our opinion, have great potential for pushing forward our present understanding of ARDS.\"\n",

      "\"Cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 is present in currently available intravenous immunoglobulinsBackground There is a crucial need for effective therapies that are immediately available to counteract COVID-19 disease. Recently, ELISA binding cross-reactivity against components of human epidemic coronaviruses with currently available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF (5% and 10%) have been reported. In this study, the same products were tested for neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their potential as an antiviral therapy. Methods The neutralization capacity of six selected lots of IVIG was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 (two different isolates), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cell cultures. Infectivity neutralization was measured by determining the percent reduction in plaque-forming units (PFU) and by cytopathic effects for two IVIG lots in one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralization was quantified using the plaque reduction neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) in the PFU assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the cytopathic/cytotoxic method (calculated as the minus log10 dilution which reduced the viral titer by 50%). Results All IVIG preparations showed neutralization of both SARS-CoV-2 isolates, ranging from 79 to 89.5% with PRNT50 titers from 4.5 to >5 for the PFU method and ranging from 47.0%-64.7% with an IC50 ~1 for the cytopathic method. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3. No IVIG preparation showed significant neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. Conclusion In cell culture neutralization assays, the tested IVIG products contain antibodies with significant cross-neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. However, no neutralization capacity was demonstrated against MERS-CoV. These preparations are currently available and may be immediately useful for COVID-19 management.\"\n",

      "\"Clinical differences between respiratory viral and bacterial mono- and dual pathogen detected among Singapore military servicemen with febrile respiratory illnessBACKGROUND: Although it is known that febrile respiratory illnesses (FRI) may be caused by multiple respiratory pathogens, there are no population-level studies describing its impact on clinical disease. METHODS: Between May 2009 and October 2012, 7733 FRI patients and controls in the Singapore military had clinical data and nasal wash samples collected prospectively and sent for PCR testing. Patients with one pathogen detected (mono-pathogen) were compared with those with two pathogens (dual pathogen) for differences in basic demographics and clinical presentation. RESULTS: In total, 45.8% had one pathogen detected, 20.2% had two pathogens detected, 30.9% had no pathogens detected, and 3.1% had more than two pathogens. Multiple pathogens were associated with recruits, those with asthma and non-smokers. Influenza A (80.0%), influenza B (73.0%) and mycoplasma (70.6%) were most commonly associated with mono-infections, while adenovirus was most commonly associated with dual infections (62.9%). Influenza A paired with S. pneumoniae had higher proportions of chills and rigors than their respective mono-pathogens (P = 0.03, P = 0.009). H. influenzae paired with either enterovirus or parainfluenzae had higher proportions of cough with phlegm than their respective mono-pathogens. Although there were observed differences in mean proportions of body temperature, nasal symptoms, sore throat, body aches and joint pains between viral and bacterial mono-pathogens, there were few differences between distinct dual-pathogen pairs and their respective mono-pathogen counterparts. CONCLUSION: A substantial number of FRI patients have multiple pathogens detected. Observed clinical differences between patients of dual pathogen and mono-pathogen indicate the likely presence of complex microbial interactions between the various pathogens.\"\n",

      "\"Effects of total fat intake on bodyweight in children.BACKGROUND As part of efforts to prevent childhood overweight and obesity, we need to understand the relationship between total fat intake and body fatness in generally healthy children. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects and associations of total fat intake on measures of weight and body fatness in children and young people not aiming to lose weight. SEARCH METHODS For this update we revised the previous search strategy and ran it over all years in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Embase (Ovid) (current to 23 May 2017). No language and publication status limits were applied. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished studies (5 June 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 24 months to 18 years, with or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, randomised to a lower fat (30% or less of total energy (TE)) versus usual or moderate-fat diet (greater than 30%TE), without the intention to reduce weight, and assessed a measure of weight or body fatness after at least six months. We included prospective cohort studies if they related baseline total fat intake to weight or body fatness at least 12 months later. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data on participants, interventions or exposures, controls and outcomes, and trial or cohort quality characteristics, as well as data on potential effect modifiers, and assessed risk of bias for all included studies. We extracted body weight and blood lipid levels outcomes at six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to five years and more than five years for RCTs; and for cohort studies, at baseline to one year, one to two years, two to five years, five to 10 years and more than 10 years. We planned to perform random-effects meta-analyses with relevant subgrouping, and sensitivity and funnel plot analyses where data allowed. MAIN RESULTS We included 24 studies comprising three parallel-group RCTs (n = 1054 randomised) and 21 prospective analytical cohort studies (about 25,059 children completed). Twenty-three studies were conducted in high-income countries. No meta-analyses were possible, since only one RCT reported the same outcome at each time point range for all outcomes, and cohort studies were too heterogeneous to combine.Effects of dietary counselling to reduce total fat intake from RCTsTwo studies recruited children aged between 4 and 11 years and a third recruited children aged 12 to 13 years. Interventions were combinations of individual and group counselling, and education sessions in clinics, schools and homes, delivered by dieticians, nutritionists, behaviourists or trained, supervised teachers. Concerns about imprecision and poor reporting limited our confidence in our findings. In addition, the inclusion of hypercholesteraemic children in two trials raised concerns about applicability.One study of dietary counselling to lower total fat intake found that the intervention may make little or no difference to weight compared with usual diet at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -0.50 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to 0.78; n = 620; low-quality evidence) and at three years (MD -0.60 kg, 95% CI -2.39 to 1.19; n = 612; low-quality evidence). Education delivered as a classroom curriculum probably decreased BMI in children at 17 months (MD -1.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.55; 1 RCT; n = 191; moderate-quality evidence). The effects were smaller at longer term follow-up (five years: MD 0 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63; n = 541; seven years; MD -0.10 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; n = 576; low-quality evidence).Dietary counselling probably slightly reduced total cholesterol at 12 months compared to controls (MD -0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), but may make little or no difference over longer time periods. Dietary counselling probably slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at 12 months (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04; 1 RCT; n = 618, moderate-quality evidence) and at five years (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01; 1 RCT; n = 623; moderate-quality evidence), compared to controls. Dietary counselling probably made little or no difference to HDL-C at 12 months (MD -0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), and at five years (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04; 1 RCT; n = 522; moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, counselling probably made little or no difference to triglycerides in children at 12 months (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence). Lower versus usual or modified fat intake may make little or no difference to height at seven years (MD -0.60 cm, 95% CI -2.06 to 0.86; 1 RCT; n = 577; low-quality evidence).Associations between total fat intake, weight and body fatness from cohort studiesOver half the cohort analyses that reported on primary outcomes suggested that as total fat intake increases, body fatness measures may move in the same direction. However, heterogeneous methods and reporting across cohort studies, and predominantly very low-quality evidence, made it difficult to draw firm conclusions and true relationships may be substantially different. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We were unable to reach firm conclusions. Limited evidence from three trials that randomised children to dietary counselling or education to lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) versus usual or modified fat intake, but with no intention to reduce weight, showed small reductions in body mass index, total- and LDL-cholesterol at some time points with lower fat intake compared to controls. There were no consistent effects on weight, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or height. Associations in cohort studies that related total fat intake to later measures of body fatness in children were inconsistent and the quality of this evidence was mostly very low. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries, and may not be applicable in low- and middle-income settings. High-quality, longer-term studies are needed, that include low- and middle-income settings to look at both possible benefits and harms.\"\n",

The aims of this study were to characterise the acute phase response (APR) of the cat to experimental infection with Mhf or CMhm, and to determine whether chronic feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection influences this response. The acute phase proteins serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp) and α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) concentrations were measured pre-infection and every 7–14 days up to day 100 post-infection (pi) in cats infected with either Mhf or CMhm. Half of each group of cats (6/12) were chronically and subclinically infected with FIV. Marbofloxacin treatment was given on days 16–44 pi to half of the Mhf-infected cats, and on days 49–77 pi to half of the CMhm-infected cats. FIV-infected animals had significantly lower AGP concentrations, and significantly greater Hp concentrations than non-FIV-infected cats when infected with CMhm and Mhf, respectively. Both CMhm and Mhf infection were associated with significant increases in SAA concentrations, while AGP concentrations were only significantly increased by Mhf infection. Mhf-infected cats had significantly greater SAA concentrations than CMhm-infected animals. Both Mhf and CMhm infections were associated with an APR, with Mhf infection inducing a greater response. Chronic FIV infection appeared to modify the APR, which varied with the infecting Haemoplasma species.\"\n",

Considering that SARS-CoV-2 cannot tolerate temperatures above 70 °C, here we designed and fabricated efficient air disinfection systems based on heated nickel (Ni) foam to catch and kill SARS-CoV-2. Virus test results revealed that 99.8% of the aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 was caught and killed by a single pass through a Ni-foam-based filter when heated up to 200 °C. Additionally, the same filter was also used to catch and kill 99.9% of Bacillus anthracis, an airborne spore. This study paves the way for preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other highly infectious airborne agents in closed environments.

      "\"Hidden Silent Codes in Viral GenomesViruses are small infectious agents that replicate only inside the living cells of other organisms and comprise approximately 94% of the nucleic acid-containing particles in the oceans. They are believed to play a central role in evolution, are responsible for various human diseases, and have important contributions to biotechnology and nanotechnology. Viruses undergo evolutionary selection for efficient transmission from host to host by exploiting the host’s gene expression machinery (e.g., ribosomes) for the expression of the genes encoded in their genomes. As a result, viral genes tend to be expressed via non-canonical mechanisms that are very rare in living organisms. Many of the gene expression stages and other aspects of the viral life cycle are encoded in the viral transcripts via ‘silent codes’, and are induced by mutations that are synonymous to the viral amino acid content. In a series of studies that included the analyses of dozens of organisms from the three domains of life, it was shown that there are overlapping ‘silent codes’ in the genetic code that are related to all stages of gene expression regulation. The aim of this chapter is to summarize the current knowledge related to the silent codes in viral genomes and the open questions in the field.\"\n",

According to the most recent literature, bacteria could be considered also as one of the major causes of asthma exacerbations that we need to further explore. RECENT FINDINGS The availability of novel methods to detect large panels of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria specific for the upper respiratory tract, together with the capacity of evaluating how basophils are activated, has changed the point of view of the mechanisms related to asthma exacerbations. The recent finding that basophils are activated in the presence of suboptimal doses of allergens and bacteria has been recently described and may explain the clinical behavior of allergy exacerbation. Indeed the activation of basophils induces the secretion of mediators, which, at bronchial level, may cause bronchospasm that leads to an asthma exacerbation in patients with infection. The contrary is also true. SUMMARY Although the explanations for these facts are numerous, at present, bacteria seem to play a relevant role in the worsening of asthma in infected patients.\"\n",

      "\"Diffusion Tensor Driven Image Registration: A Deep Learning ApproachTracking microsctructural changes in the developing brain relies on accurate inter-subject image registration. However, most methods rely on either structural or diffusion data to learn the spatial correspondences between two or more images, without taking into account the complementary information provided by using both. Here we propose a deep learning registration framework which combines the structural information provided by [Formula: see text]-weighted ([Formula: see text]w) images with the rich microstructural information offered by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans. This allows our trained network to register pairs of images in a single pass. We perform a leave-one-out cross-validation study where we compare the performance of our multi-modality registration model with a baseline model trained on structural data only, in terms of Dice scores and differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Our results show that in terms of average Dice scores our model performs better in subcortical regions when compared to using structural data only. Moreover, average sum-of-squared differences between warped and fixed FA maps show that our proposed model performs better at aligning the diffusion data.\"\n",

Fifty-one patients had proven/probable aspergillosis. We compared galactomannan (GM), PCR and mycologic analysis of pulmonary samples in both neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients. PCR performed in serum yielded 66.7% sensitivity, 98.7% specificity, 75.6% positive predictive value and 98.0% negative predictive value, while the GM index yielded 78.4% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, 27% positive predictive value and 98.6% negative predictive value. The inclusion of PCR in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycosis Study Group (MSG) mycologic criteria permitted the reclassification of nine other cases from possible to probable aspergillosis and increased the sensitivity to 71.7%. Combining the GM index with serum PCR increased the detection rate of invasive aspergillosis with 88.2% sensitivity. PCR was systematically negative in 16 patients with noninvasive forms of aspergillosis (namely aspergilloma and chronic aspergillosis). Remaining PCR positive after a period of 14 to 20 days of treatment was related to poor outcome at 30 and 90 days. Our results also indicate that, unlike the determination of the GM index, the initial fungus load as determined by PCR was highly predictive of 90-day mortality, with the rate of the latter being 15.8% for patients with <150 copies/mL vs. 73.2% for patients at or above that cutoff (p <0.0001). Therefore, PCR appears to be a powerful and interesting tool for the identification of patients with invasive aspergillosis who might benefit from more intense care.\"\n",

      "\"Conditional knockout of RAD51-related genes in Leishmania major reveals a critical role for homologous recombination during genome replicationHomologous recombination (HR) has an intimate relationship with genome replication, both during repair of DNA lesions that might prevent DNA synthesis and in tackling stalls to the replication fork. Recent studies led us to ask if HR might have a more central role in replicating the genome of Leishmania, a eukaryotic parasite. Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding whether or not HR genes are essential, and genome-wide mapping has provided evidence for an unorthodox organisation of DNA replication initiation sites, termed origins. To answer this question, we have employed a combined CRISPR/Cas9 and DiCre approach to rapidly generate and assess the effect of conditional ablation of RAD51 and three RAD51-related proteins in Leishmania major. Using this approach, we demonstrate that loss of any of these HR factors is not immediately lethal but in each case growth slows with time and leads to DNA damage and accumulation of cells with aberrant DNA content. Despite these similarities, we show that only loss of RAD51 or RAD51-3 impairs DNA synthesis and causes elevated levels of genome-wide mutation. Furthermore, we show that these two HR factors act in distinct ways, since ablation of RAD51, but not RAD51-3, has a profound effect on DNA replication, causing loss of initiation at the major origins and increased DNA synthesis at subtelomeres. Our work clarifies questions regarding the importance of HR to survival of Leishmania and reveals an unanticipated, central role for RAD51 in the programme of genome replication in a microbial eukaryote.\"\n",

      "\"HAEPG: An Automatic Multi-hop Exploitation Generation FrameworkAutomatic exploit generation for heap vulnerabilities is an open challenge. Current studies require a sensitive pointer on the heap to hijack the control flow and pay little attention to vulnerabilities with limited capabilities. In this paper, we propose HAEPG, an automatic exploit framework that can utilize known exploitation techniques to guide exploit generation. We implemented a prototype of HAEPG based on the symbolic execution engine S2E [15] and provided four exploitation techniques for it as prior knowledge. HAEPG takes crashing inputs, programs, and prior knowledge as input, and generates exploits for vulnerabilities with limited capabilities by abusing heap allocator’s internal functionalities. We evaluated HAEPG with 24 CTF programs, and the results show that HAEPG is able to accurately reason about the type of vulnerability for 21 (87.5%) of them, and generate exploits that spawn a shell for 16 (66.7%) of them. All the exploits could bypass NX [25] and Full RELRO [28] security mechanisms.\"\n",

      "\"Novel Mechanisms Revealed in the Trachea Transcriptome of Resistant and Susceptible Chicken Lines following Infection with Newcastle Disease VirusNewcastle disease virus (NDV) has a devastating impact on poultry production in developing countries. This study examined the transcriptome of tracheal epithelial cells from two inbred chicken lines that differ in NDV susceptibility after challenge with a high-titer inoculum of lentogenic NDV. The Fayoumi line had a significantly lower NDV load postchallenge than the Leghorn line, demonstrating the Fayoumi line's classification as a relatively NDV-resistant breed. Examination of the trachea transcriptome showed a large increase in immune cell infiltration in the trachea in both lines at all times postinfection. The pathways conserved across lines and at all three time points postinfection included iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, NF-κB signaling, the role of nuclear factor of activated T cells in the regulation of the immune response, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, phospholipase C signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper cells. Although shared pathways were seen in the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines, each line showed unique responses as well. The downregulation of collagen and the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 signaling in the Fayoumis relative to the Leghorns at 2 days postinfection may contribute to the resistance phenotype seen in the Fayoumis. This study provides a further understanding of host-pathogen interactions which could improve vaccine efficacy and, in combination with genome-wide association studies, has the potential to advance strategies for breeding chickens with enhanced resistance to NDV.\"\n",

Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is a technique that has been shown to be safe and feasible, but this appears to be the case only for experienced surgeons. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of minimally invasive surgery fellow participation during SILC. METHODS We reviewed data from our experience with SILC during 3 years. The cases were divided in two groups: group 1 comprised procedures performed by the main attending without the presence of the fellow, and group 2 comprised procedures performed with the fellow present during the operation. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, indication for surgery, total surgical time, hospital length of stay, and complications were evaluated. RESULTS The cohort included 229 patients: 142 (62%) were included in group 1 and 87 (38%) in group 2. No differences were found in demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and indication for surgery between groups. The total surgical time was 34.4 ± 11.4 minutes for group 1 and 46.8 ± 16.0 minutes for group 2 (P < .001). The hospital length of stay was 0.89 0.32 days for group 1 and 1.01 ± 0.40 days for group 2 (P = .027). No intraoperative complications were seen in either group. There were 3 postoperative complications (2.1%) in group 1 and none in group 2 (P = .172). CONCLUSION Adoption of SILC during an established fellowship program is safe and feasible. A longer surgical time is expected during the teaching process.\"\n",

Trypsin cleaved the α1 protein (49K molecular weight) approximately in the middle and yielded a 26K N-terminal fragment and a 23K C-terminal fragment. Under conditions which allowed for the identification of intact σ1 in the oligomeric form (∼200K) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the N-terminal 26K fragment was found to exist as stable trimers (80K) and, to a less extent, as dimers (54K), whereas the C-terminal fragment remained in the monomeric form. A polypeptide (161 amino acids) containing the N-terminal heptad repeat region synthesized in vitro was capable of forming stable dimers and trimers. Using various criteria, we demonstrated that the stability of the intact σ1 oligomer is conferred mainly by the N-terminal heptad repeat region. Our results are summarized in a model in which individual heptad repeats are held together in a three-stranded α-helical coiled-coil structure via both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.\"\n",

In the current study, an experimental protocol was developed to evaluate the contributions of the abdominal wall components to the structural response of the anterior part of the abdominal wall. The specimens underwent 3 dissections (removal of (1) skin and subcutaneous fat, (2) anterior rectus sheath, (3) rectus abdominis muscles). After each dissection, they were subjected to air pressure up to 3 kPa. Ultrasound images and associated elastographic maps were collected at 0, 2 and 3 kPa in the intact state and strains on the internal surface were calculated using stereo-correlation in all states. Strains on the rectus abdominis and linea alba were analyzed. After the dissection of the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominis, longitudinal strain was found significantly different on the linea alba (5% at 3 kPa) and on the rectus abdominis area (11% at 3 kPa). The current results highlight the importance of the rectus sheath in the structural response of the anterior part of the abdominal wall ex vivo. Geometrical characteristics such as thicknesses and radii of curvature and mechanical properties (shear modulus of the rectus abdominis, e.g. at 0 pressure the average value is 14 kPa) were provided in order to facilitate future modeling efforts.\"\n",

METHODS From July 2005 to December 2008, 227 patients underwent colorectal resection for cancer at S. Martino Hospital in Genoa. Sixty-one patients underwent curative rectal resection for mid or low rectal cancer using Ligasure™ device applied on smaller vessels and for the execution of total mesorectal excision. Forty-six patients underwent open laparotomy (OL), 15 laparoscopic surgery. There were no differences concerning demographics data and diagnosis, but only regarding staging (P=0.009). Primary goal was to evaluate major complications, operating time, hospital stay, distal margin of the tumor and number of nodes harvested in specimen. Secondary goal was to assess the average time of survival in the short period. RESULTS The mean operative times were shorter in the OL group (188 vs. 246 min) overall. This difference was significant (P=0.004). In particular two parameters of specimens were analyzed: the total number of nodes and distal clearing from cancer, excluding abdominoperineal resection. An average number of 16.6 nodes in the OL group and 13.9 in the VL group (P=ns) were detected; mean distal clearing in the OL group was 30.7 mm and 48.1 mm in the VL group (P=ns). There were no differences concerning major complications in either group. The hospital stay in the VL group was shorter than in the OL group, but the differences were not significant. CONCLUSION The Ligasure™ device does not reduce operating time in laparoscopy rectal cancer resection but it allows to get correct oncologic results in patients submitted to total mesorectal excision.\"\n",

      "\"Modified MILLER banding procedure for managing high-flow access and dialysis-associated steal syndrome.PURPOSE Both high-flow vascular access (VA) and dialysis-associated steal syndrome are serious complications requiring a flow reduction technique. We adopted the minimally invasive limited ligation endoluminal-assisted revision (MILLER) banding procedure with some modifications to control the high blood flow and steal syndrome during VA procedures and retrospectively assessed the outcome. METHODS Seven patients with high-flow access (access flow >1400 ml/min) and five patients with steal syndrome (with pain, coldness, or cyanosis) were treated using the MILLER banding method. Flow volume of the brachial artery was monitored using Doppler ultrasonography during the banding procedure. In patients with steal syndrome, the finger probe of a pulse oximeter was attached to a finger on the ipsilateral side, and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was monitored. RESULTS In the high-flow group, the mean access blood flow (Qa) decreased from 2043 ± 463 ml/min (mean ± SD) to 1248 ± 388 ml/min (p<0.001). In the steal syndrome group, the SpO2 value improved in all steal syndrome patients after banding. Symptoms were almost relieved in two steal syndrome patients. The Qa in the steal group decreased from 997 ± 867 to 548 ± 376 ml/min (p = 0.12). The secondary patency rates of the high-flow and steal groups at 6 months were 83.3% and 50%, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a convenience sample of professionals from 30 health centers and 30 nursing homes from the primary care management division of the Healthcare Area of Leon. The work center, type of profession, COVID-19 infection, level of exposure, compliance with preventive measures, isolation (if required) and diagnostic tests carried out were collected. The determination of infection was made by differentiated rapid diagnostic test (dRDT), using a finger-stick whole-blood sample. The association of variables with infection was assessed by multivariable non-conditional logistic regression. The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was calculated according to two scenarios for RDT (Sensitivity=0.6 and Specificity=0.985; Sensitivity=0.8 and Specificity=1). RESULTS: The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 4.9% and 11.0%. The observed prevalence was 5.9% and was higher in nursing homes than in primary care centers (9.5% vs. 5.5%). No statistically significant differences were observed by sex, type of professional, level of exposure or compliance with preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this group is low. A high number of professionals remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore protective measures should be taken, especially for professionals working in nursing homes.\"\n",

      "\"Transplantation of highly purified peripheral blood CD34(+) cells from HLA-mismatched parental donors in 14 children: evaluation of early monitoring of engraftmentHLA-mismatched family members may represent an important cell source for patients that require stem cell transplantation but lack both a matched sibling donor and a closely matched unrelated donor. We report the outcome of 19 transplantations from HLA two- or three- loci mismatched parental donors in which 14 pediatric patients with hematological malignancies or other disorders, received a median of 21.5 × 10(6) (range, 5.4–58) highly purified CD34(+)peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), as well as 4.7 × 10(4) (range, 0.4–12) donor T cells per kg body weight. T cell depletion was performed using a two-step CD34-positive selection on two different magnetic beads devices. Ten of 14 patients presented with rapid myeloid engraftment. The four patients who presented with graft failure (two non-engraftments, two rejections) received a second stem cell graft and one a third. Graft rejection was detected early by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of FACS-sorted T cells. Eight of the 14 patients are still alive after a median observation period of 15.6 months (range, 3–31.3) with full donor chimerism in all hematopoietic cell lineages. No acute organ graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and no chronic GVHD have occurred. One patient experienced relapse of leukemia. We conclude that transplantation of allogeneic PBSC from haploidentical donors will open new perspectives for pediatric patients for whom an HLA-matched stem cell graft is not available. Close monitoring of recipient and donor hematopoiesis might be of clinical value, to recognize early engraftment or rejection.\"\n",

Perioperative monitoring of patient temperature is, therefore, standard practice. Postoperative temperature is regarded as a key anaesthetic performance indicator in Australian hospitals. Many different methods and sites of temperature measurement are used perioperatively. It is unclear to what degree these methods might be interchangeable. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between temperatures measured at different sites in anaesthetised children. Two hundred children, 0 to 17 years, undergoing general anaesthesia for elective non-cardiac surgery, were prospectively recruited. Temperature measurements were taken in the operating theatre concurrently at the nasopharynx, tympanic membranes, temporal artery, axilla and skin (chest). Patient age and weight were documented. Temperatures varied according to site of measurement. The mean difference from nasopharyngeal temperature to temperatures at left and right tympanic, temporal, axillary and cutaneous sites were +0.24°C, +0.24°C, +0.35°C, -0.38°C and -1.70°C, respectively. Levels of agreement to nasopharyngeal temperature were similar at tympanic, temporal and axillary sites. Tympanic and temporal temperatures were superior to axillary temperatures for detection of mild hypothermia (<36°C). Skin temperature showed a large variation from nasopharyngeal measurements. Our findings indicate that measured temperatures vary between sites. Understanding these variations is important for interpreting temperature readings.\"\n",

Diarrhoeal faecal samples were collected from 590 calves (<3 months old) throughout the country from November 2013 through March 2015. Data were analysed according to the region of collection, season, and type of diarrhoea. Of the 590 collected faecal samples, 77 (13.1 per cent) and 78 (13.2 per cent; true prevalence 9.1 per cent) tested positive by PCR and ELISA, respectively. The results from both testing methods were in agreement in 501 (84.9 per cent) samples, with a κ value of 0.34, which suggests fair agreement. The PCR results showed a higher prevalence in summer and in cases of haemorrhagic diarrhoea (P<0.05), while the ELISA results showed a lower prevalence in cases of pasty diarrhoea (P<0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of the β-giardin gene sequences of G duodenalis showed that the sequences detected in this study belonged to assemblage E, which is specific to cattle and livestock. The higher prevalence of giardiasis in calves with haemorrhagic diarrhoea found in this study differed from previous studies. Therefore, researchers and veterinarians should be aware of the possible involvement of giardiasis in haemorrhagic diarrhoea.\"\n",

      "\"Immune Predictors of Mortality After Ribonucleic Acid Virus InfectionBACKGROUND: Virus infections result in a range of clinical outcomes for the host, from asymptomatic to severe or even lethal disease. Despite global efforts to prevent and treat virus infections to limit morbidity and mortality, the continued emergence and re-emergence of new outbreaks as well as common infections such as influenza persist as a health threat. Challenges to the prevention of severe disease after virus infection include both a paucity of protective vaccines as well as the early identification of individuals with the highest risk that may require supportive treatment. METHODS: We completed a screen of mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) that we infected with influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, and West Nile virus. RESULTS: The CC mice exhibited a range of disease manifestations upon infections, and we used this natural variation to identify strains with mortality after infection and strains exhibiting no mortality. We then used comprehensive preinfection immunophenotyping to identify global baseline immune correlates of protection from mortality to virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that immune phenotypes might be leveraged to identify humans at highest risk of adverse clinical outcomes upon infection, who may most benefit from intensive clinical interventions, in addition to providing insight for rational vaccine design.\"\n",

      "\"Prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumoniaBackground In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, progression to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. Methods We conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results Findings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 plus-or-minus sign 9.0 vs. 17.5 plus-or-minus sign 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). Conclusion In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.\"\n",

Brains pose an explanatory challenge because entropy, which inexorably increases over time, is commonly associated with disorder and simplicity. Recently we showed how evolution is an entropic process, building structures – organisms – which themselves facilitate entropy growth. Here we suggest that key transitional points in evolution extended organisms’ reach into space and time, opening channels into new regions of a complex multi-dimensional state space that also allow entropy to increase. Brain evolution enabled representation of space and time, which vastly enhances this process. Some of these channels lead to tiny, dead-ends in the state space: the persistence of complex life is thus not thermodynamically guaranteed.\"\n",

      "\"Telomere Dynamics in Immune Senescence and Exhaustion Triggered by Chronic Viral InfectionThe progressive loss of immunological memory during aging correlates with a reduced proliferative capacity and shortened telomeres of T cells. Growing evidence suggests that this phenotype is recapitulated during chronic viral infection. The antigenic volume imposed by persistent and latent viruses exposes the immune system to unique challenges that lead to host T-cell exhaustion, characterized by impaired T-cell functions. These dysfunctional memory T cells lack telomerase, the protein capable of extending and stabilizing chromosome ends, imposing constraints on telomere dynamics. A deleterious consequence of this excessive telomere shortening is the premature induction of replicative senescence of viral-specific CD8+ memory T cells. While senescent cells are unable to expand, they can survive for extended periods of time and are more resistant to apoptotic signals. This review takes a closer look at T-cell exhaustion in chronic viruses known to cause human disease: Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B/C/D virus (HBV/HCV/HDV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus-1/2 (HSV-1/2), and Varicella–Zoster virus (VZV). Current literature linking T-cell exhaustion with critical telomere lengths and immune senescence are discussed. The concept that enduring antigen stimulation leads to T-cell exhaustion that favors telomere attrition and a cell fate marked by enhanced T-cell senescence appears to be a common endpoint to chronic viral infections.\"\n",

More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far. Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Results: Of 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow-up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non-severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10-16.5) and 23 (18-24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, the severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration. Conclusions: COVID-19 has significantly shorter duration of disease and hospital length of stay than SARS. Bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter period of illness onset to admission, lymphopenia, the severity of disease are the risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID-19.\"\n",

      "\"Forecasting COVID-19 impact on hospital bed-days, ICU-days, ventilator-days and deaths by US state in the next 4 monthsKey Points Question: Assuming social distancing measures are maintained, what are the forecasted gaps in available health service resources and number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic for each state in the United States? Findings: Using a statistical model, we predict excess demand will be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. Peak ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674) ventilators. Peak demand will be in the second week of April. We estimate 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths in the United States from COVID-19 over the next 4 months. Meaning: Even with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially. Alongside the implementation and enforcement of social distancing measures, there is an urgent need to develop and implement plans to reduce non-COVID-19 demand for and temporarily increase capacity of health facilities. Abstract Importance: This study presents the first set of estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US. Objective: To determine the extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months. Exposure(s): COVID-19. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use. Results: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will a total of 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6. Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. These are urgently needed given that peak volumes are estimated to be only three weeks away. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures in all states that have not done so already within the next week and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.\"\n",

      "\"SS3D: Sequence similarity in 3D for comparison of protein familiesHomologous proteins are often compared by pairwise sequence alignment, and structure superposition if the atomic coordinates are available. Unification of sequence and structure data is an important task in structural biology. Here, we present Sequence Similarity 3D (SS3D), a new method for integrating sequence and structure information for comparison of homologous proteins. SS3D quantifies the spatial similarity of residues within a given radius of homologous through-space contacts. The spatial alignments are scored using native BLOSUM and PAM substitution matrices. This work details the SS3D approach and demonstrates its utility through case studies comparing members of several protein families: GPCR, p53, kelch, SUMO, and SARS coronavirus spike protein. We show that SS3D can more clearly highlight biologically important regions of similarity and dissimilarity compared to pairwise sequence alignments or structure superposition alone. SS3D is written in C++, and is available with a manual and tutorial at https://github.com/0x462e41/SS3D/.\"\n",

      "\"Female sexual function after pure transvaginal appendectomy: a cohort study.BACKGROUND The impact of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) on female sexual function is unknown. We therefore performed a prospective cohort study of women undergoing pure transvaginal appendectomies (TVA) versus traditional laparoscopic appendectomies (LA). Using a validated, 19-point, female sexual function index questionnaire (FSFI) assessing six domains of sexual function (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain with intercourse), pre- and postoperative sexual function was compared. METHODS Between August 2008 and August 2010, 42 patients with acute appendicitis were offered a pure TVA. Patients who did not wish to undergo a TVA underwent an LA and served as controls. Both groups were provided with an FSFI before surgery and at regular intervals for up to 1 year. Pre- and postoperative FSFI results were compared between cohorts using unpaired t tests, and between individuals within each cohort pre- and postoperatively using paired t tests. RESULTS Twenty-two underwent LA, 18 patients underwent a pure TVA, and 2 refused participation in this study. Preoperative and >60 days postoperative FSFI data were available for 21 patients (10 LA and 11 TVA). Baseline FSFI scores were not significantly different between groups (LA, 19.3 ± 0.9; TVA, 19.3 ± 0.8, p = 0.99). FSFI scores at greater than 60 days postoperatively did not differ significantly from FSFI scores preoperatively in either group (LA, 19.3 ± 0.9 to 19.7 ± 0.7; p = 0.87; TVA, 19.3 ± 0.8 to 19.4 ± 0.9; p = 0.97). No FSFI domain in either cohort was significantly changed postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Neither LA nor TVA affected female sexual function scores. This suggests that TVA does not have negative effects on female sexual function. The results of this study may prove beneficial in consultations with patients concerning the sexual sequelae of transvaginal surgery.\"\n",

      "\"The computation of case fatality rate for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) based on Bayes theorem: An observational studyBACKGROUND: When a new disease such starts to spread, the commonly asked questions are how deadly is it? and how many people are likely to die of this outbreak? The World Health Organization (WHO) announced in a press conference on January 29, 2020 that the death rate of COVID-19 was 2% on the case fatality rate (CFR). It was underestimated assuming no lag days from symptom onset to deaths while many CFR formulas have been proposed, the estimation on Bays theorem is worthy of interpretation. Hence, it is hypothesized that the over-loaded burdens of treating patients and capacities to contain the outbreak (LSBHRS) may increase the CFR. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak numbers from January 21 to February 14, 2020, in countries/regions on a daily basis from Github that contains information on confirmed cases in >30 Chinese locations and other countries/regions. The pros and cons were compared among the 5 formula of CFR, including [A] deaths/confirmed; [B] deaths/(deathsâ+ârecovered); [C] deaths/(cases x days ago); [D] Bayes estimation based on [A] and the outbreak (LSBHRS) in each country/region; and [E] Bayes estimation based on [C] deaths/(cases x days ago). The coefficients of variance (CVâ=âthe ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) were applied to measure the relative variability for each CFR. A dashboard was developed for daily display of the CFR across each region. RESULTS: The Bayes based on (A)[D] has the lowest CV (=0.10) followed by the deaths/confirmed (=0.11) [A], deaths/(deathsâ+ârecoveries) (=0.42) [B], Bayes based on (C) (=0.49) [E], and deaths/(cases x days ago) (=0.59) [C]. All final CFRs will be equal using the formula (from, A to E). A dashboard was developed for the daily reporting of the CFR. The CFR (3.7%) greater than the prior CFR of 2.2% was evident in LSBHRS, increasing the CFR. A dashboard was created to present the CFRs on COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We suggest examining both trends of the Bayes based on both deaths/(cases 7 days ago) and deaths/confirmed cases as a reference to the final CFR. An app developed for displaying the provisional CFR with the 2 CFR trends can improve the underestimated CFR reported by WHO and media.\"\n",

      "\"Programmes to support transitions in care for children and youth with complex care needs and their families: a scoping review protocol.INTRODUCTION Children and youth with complex care needs (CCNs) and their families experience many care transitions over their lifespan and are consequently vulnerable to the discontinuity or gaps in care that can occur during these transitions. Transitional care programmes, broadly defined as one or more intervention(s) or service(s) that aim to improve continuity of care, are increasingly being developed to address transitions in care for children and youth with CCNs. However, this literature has not yet been systematically examined at a comprehensive level. The purpose of this scoping review is to map the range of programmes that support transitions in care for children and youth with CCNs and their families during two phases of their lifespan: (1) up to the age of 19 years (not including their transition to adult healthcare) and (2) when transitioning from paediatric to adult healthcare. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews (ScR) will be used for the proposed scoping review. ScR are a type of knowledge synthesis that are useful for addressing exploratory research questions that aim to map key concepts and types of evidence on a topic and can be used to organise what is known about the phenomena. A preliminary search of PubMed was conducted in December 2018. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required where this study is a review of the published and publicly reported literature. The research team's advisory council will develop a research dissemination strategy with goals, target audiences, expertise/leadership, resources and deadlines to maximise project outputs. The end-of-grant activities will be used to raise awareness, promote action and inform future research, policy and practice on this topic.\"\n",

However, published data result mainly from retrospective monocentric studies. We initiated a multi-institutional, prospective, board-reviewed registry for patients treated with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in Germany in 2009. In five centers, 297 patients were registered. Primary tumors were mainly derived from pancreas (117/297) and small intestine (80/297), whereas 56 were of unknown primary. Most tumors were well differentiated with median Ki67 proliferation rate of 5% (range 0.9-70%). Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy was performed using mainly yttrium-90 and/or lutetium-177 as radionuclides in 1-8 cycles. Mean overall survival was estimated at 213 months with follow-up between 1 and 230 months after initial diagnosis, and 87 months with follow-up between 1 and 92 months after start of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Median overall survival was not yet reached. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that best results were obtained in neuroendocrine tumors with proliferation rate below 20%. Our results indicate that peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is an effective treatment for well- and moderately differentiated neuroendocrine tumors irrespective of previous therapies and should be regarded as one of the primary treatment options for patients with somatostatin receptor-expressing neuroendocrine tumors.\"\n",

They are involved in the protection of sperm cells against immune response in the female reproductive tract by modulating the complement system and by inhibiting monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis and lymphocyte proliferation. The immunomodulatory function most probably involves small non-coding RNAs present in prostasomes. Prostasomes have also been proposed to regulate the timing of sperm cell capacitation and induction of the acrosome reaction, since they are rich in various transferable bioactive molecules (e.g. receptors and enzymes) that promote the fertilising ability of sperm cells. Antigenicity of sperm cells has been well documented and implicated in involuntary immunological infertility of human couples, and antisperm antibodies (ASA) occur in several body fluids. The propensity of sperm cells to carry attached prostasomes suggests that they are a new category of sperm antigens. Circulating human ASA recognise prostasomes, and among 12 identified prostasomal antigens, prolactin- inducible protein (95 %) and clusterin (85 %) were immunodominant at the expense of the other 10 that were sporadically occurring.\"\n",

      "\"Air ventilation assessment under unstable atmospheric stratification — A comparative study for Hong KongAbstract In most current air ventilation assessment (AVA) studies, a simple neutral assumption that does not consider thermal effects is adopted, particularly for numerical simulation practices. With statistics of daytime observations during summer in Hong Kong as an example, this study demonstrates that neutral atmospheric boundary conditions occur with a very low probability, which implies that current practices are indeed far away from reality. This study is devoted to addressing this knowledge gap by cross-comparisons of field measurements, wind tunnel tests, and large-eddy simulations (LES) under neutral and unstable conditions. It is found that LES-computed velocity ratios under unstable conditions are in line with field measurements, while results of simulations under neutral conditions are close to those of wind tunnel tests. Enhanced vertical mixing due to surface heating produces improved ventilation performance in the unstable case. The neutral assumption tends to underestimate pedestrian-level velocity ratios compared to a diabatic condition; hence it is deemed conservative when it is adopted in AVA practices. Moreover, stronger wind direction variance under unstable conditions results in weaker correlation between velocity ratios and frontal area indices than neutral conditions, which implies that street orientations become less important in ventilation under unstable conditions.\"\n",

      "\"COVID-19 Science Policy, Experts, and Publics: Why Epistemic Democracy Matters in Ecological CrisesIn times of planetary health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a critically informed science and technology policy is crucial. In this overarching context, governments are faced with making rapid and high-stake decisions dictated by emergency that in a state of normalcy they would not, or could not pursue. Governments tend to gather, therefore, an incredible amount of unchecked power in times of fast-moving ecological crises that raises concerns about where the legitimacy of such excessive power comes from. Moreover, the elected politicians rely on the expert advice in a pandemic. This takes away democratic political authority from the sovereign people and instead places it on allegedly objective unelected experts. In contrast, experts have (1) a dubious reputation in predicting the future and (2) varying degrees of biases and self-interests, which make them susceptible, for instance, to \"framing problems\" in relation to the urgent public issues at stake. This article suggests new ways of thinking about COVID-19 technology policy, drawing from the field of political science and democratic theory. It examines the power-laden tensions between the political authority and the expert authority. Going forward, I highlight the brief history of epistemic democracy, taking into consideration that in advanced modern democracies, political decision making has to draw, in part, from expert knowledge, but without resulting in democratic deficits. The COVID-19 science and technology policy can usefully build on epistemic democracy while strengthening the science, society, and democracy nexus.\"\n",

Viral, mycoplasmal, and bacterial cultures and acute- and convalescent-phase sera were obtained during 64 episodes of acute illness; additional sera were drawn annually for three to five years. On the basis of serologic evidence, none of the acute episodes appeared to be due to L. pneumophila serogroup 1 or 2. However, examination of annual serum specimens showed that 27 (52%) of the children had rises in titer of indirect immunofluorescent antibody (a fourfold or greater rise to a reciprocal titer of ⩾128). Most rises in titer were in response to the serogroup 2 antigen. These results suggest that L. pneumophila is not a common cause of acute respiratory disease in early childhood in the study area but that children are frequently exposed to the organism. Alternatively, the serologic responses might be to unrelated cross-reacting microorganisms.\"\n",

      "\"A Co-Opted DEAD-Box RNA Helicase Enhances Tombusvirus Plus-Strand SynthesisReplication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on recruited host factors that aid several critical steps during replication. In this paper, we show that an essential translation factor, Ded1p DEAD-box RNA helicase of yeast, directly affects replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). To separate the role of Ded1p in viral protein translation from its putative replication function, we utilized a cell-free TBSV replication assay and recombinant Ded1p. The in vitro data show that Ded1p plays a role in enhancing plus-strand synthesis by the viral replicase. We also find that Ded1p is a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex and Ded1p binds to the 3′-end of the viral minus-stranded RNA. The data obtained with wt and ATPase deficient Ded1p mutants support the model that Ded1p unwinds local structures at the 3′-end of the TBSV (−)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (+)-strand synthesis. Interestingly, we find that Ded1p and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is another host factor for TBSV, play non-overlapping functions to enhance (+)-strand synthesis. Altogether, the two host factors enhance TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with the viral (−)RNA and the replication proteins. In addition, we have developed an in vitro assay for Flock house virus (FHV), a small RNA virus of insects, that also demonstrated positive effect on FHV replicase activity by the added Ded1p helicase. Thus, two small RNA viruses, which do not code for their own helicases, seems to recruit a host RNA helicase to aid their replication in infected cells.\"\n",

This unprecedented situation has raised concerns about children's and adolescent's mental health. Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may find this context of restrained activity particularly tricky. The objectives of our study are to gather information about the well-being and global life conditions of children and adolescents with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak in France. METHODS: We designed a survey including both open-ended questions and questionnaire items for parents of children and adolescents with ADHD. Parents responded to the following open-ended questions: 1) \"How is your child doing since the lockdown?\" 2) \"How is life at home since the lockdown?\" 3) \"If you had a remote service provision with a mental health professional (e.g. by telephone or video technology), please share your thoughts and any suggestions with us\" 4) \"Please share any other items that you think are important about ADHD symptoms of your child and the lockdown situation\". This survey was posted on social media on the 6th of April and disseminated by French ADHD-parent and patient organizations. The present article reports the descriptive, qualitative and textometrical analyses of the survey. RESULTS: Between day 20 and 30 of lockdown, 538 parents responded to the survey, and we included 533 responses in the final analysis. The vast majority of responders were women 95 % (95 % CI 93,50; 97,18) with children whose mean age was 10,5 (95 % CI 7.58; 13.44). Since the lockdown, 34.71 % (95 % CI 30.70; 38.94) of children experienced a worsening in well-being, 34.33 % (95 % CI 30.34; 38.56) showed no significant changes and 30.96 % (95 % CI 27.09; 35.10) were doing better according to their parents. The thematic analysis showed that an improvement of their children's anxiety was one of the main topics addressed by parents. This improvement related to less school-related strain and flexible schedules that respected their children's rhythm. Improved self-esteem was another topic that parents linked with a lesser exposure of their children to negative feed-back. Parents repeatedly reported both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. However, optimal lockdown life conditions seemed to compensate for the impact of ADHD symptoms (e.g. sufficient space at home, presence of a garden). Some parents reported worsening of general well-being in their children, and this manifested as oppositional/defiant attitudes and emotional outbursts. Parents also cited sleep problems and anxiety in this context. As regards everyday life during lock-down, at-home schooling was another major topic-parents described that their children struggled to complete school-related tasks and that teachers seemed to have forgotten about academic accommodations. The lockdown situation seems to have raised parents' awareness of the role of inattention and ADHD symptoms in their children's learning difficulties. Due to potential selection biases, the results of our survey may not be generalizable to all children and adolescents with ADHD. The main strengths of this rapid survey-based study lies in the reactivity of the participants and the quality and diversity of their responses to the open-ended questions. CONCLUSIONS: According to their parents, most children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being. An improvement in school-related anxiety and the flexible adjustment to the children's' rhythms as well as parents' increased awareness of the difficulties their children experience are among the key topics in parents' descriptions.\"\n",

      "\"Could Environment Affect the Mutation of H1N1 Influenza Virus?H1N1 subtype influenza A viruses are the most common type of influenza A virus to infect humans. The two major outbreaks of the virus in 1918 and 2009 had a great impact both on human health and social development. Though data on their complete genome sequences have recently been obtained, the evolution and mutation of A/H1N1 viruses remain unknown to this day. Among many drivers, the impact of environmental factors on mutation is a novel hypothesis worth studying. Here, a geographically disaggregated method was used to explore the relationship between environmental factors and mutation of A/H1N1 viruses from 2000–2019. All of the 11,721 geo-located cases were examined and the data was analysed of six environmental elements according to the time and location (latitude and longitude) of those cases. The main mutation value was obtained by comparing the sequence of the influenza virus strain with the earliest reported sequence. It was found that environmental factors systematically affect the mutation of A/H1N1 viruses. Minimum temperature displayed a nonlinear, rising association with mutation, with a maximum ~15 °C. The effects of precipitation and social development index (nighttime light) were more complex, while population density was linearly and positively correlated with mutation of A/H1N1 viruses. Our results provide novel insight into understanding the complex relationships between mutation of A/H1N1 viruses and environmental factors.\"\n",

      "\"Short-term PsychoEducation for Carers To Reduce Over Medication of people with intellectual disabilities (SPECTROM): study protocolINTRODUCTION: Psychotropic medications that are primarily licenced for the treatment of psychiatric disorders are used widely (32%–85%) among people with intellectual disabilities (ID) often for the management of problem (challenging) behaviour in the absence of a psychiatric disorder. Care staff play a pivotal role in the prescribing process. Currently, no staff training programme exists to address the issue of overprescribing of psychotropic medication in people with ID, thus highlighting an urgent need for developing a psychoeducational programme (PEP) specifically designed to address this issue. We propose to develop a PEP for care staff using the methodology described in the UK Medical Research Council guide for complex interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The development of the PEP will involve (1) gathering information on available relevant training programmes, (2) running four focus groups with care staff and other professionals to establish the content and format of the PEP, and (3) organising a co-design event involving all relevant stakeholders to discuss the format of the PEP. A core project team will develop the PEP under guidance from the PEP Development Group which will consist of 10–12 relevant stakeholder representatives. Feedback from selected stakeholders on a draft PEP will allow us to refine the PEP before implementation. The PEP will have web-based modules supplemented by face to face training sessions. When the final draft is ready, we will field test the PEP on six to eight care staff from community care homes for people with ID. After completing the field test, we will run a focus group involving participants in the PEP to get feedback on the PEP. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval for this study was waived by the UK Health Regulatory Authority as the study does not collect any patient related information and only include care staff outside the UK NHS. This will be the first ever such universally freely available PEP supported by training manual and slides.\"\n",

      "\"Fractional Types: Expressive and Safe Space Management for Ancilla BitsIn reversible computing, the management of space is subject to two broad classes of constraints. First, as with general-purpose computation, every allocation must be paired with a matching de-allocation. Second, space can only be safely de-allocated if its contents are restored to their initial value from allocation time. Generally speaking, the state of the art provides limited partial solutions, either leaving both constraints to programmers’ assertions or imposing a stack discipline to address the first constraint and leaving the second constraint to programmers’ assertions. We propose a novel approach based on the idea of fractional types. As a simple intuitive example, allocation of a new boolean value initialized to [Image: see text] also creates a value [Image: see text] that can be thought of as a garbage collection (GC) process specialized to reclaim, and only reclaim, storage containing the value [Image: see text]. This GC process is a first-class entity that can be manipulated, decomposed into smaller processes and combined with other GC processes. We formalize this idea in the context of a reversible language founded on type isomorphisms, prove its fundamental correctness properties, and illustrate its expressiveness using a wide variety of examples. The development is backed by a fully-formalized Agda implementation (https://github.com/DreamLinuxer/FracAncilla).\"\n",

Despite their substantial effects on global public health and growing understanding of the process by which they emerge, no pandemic has been predicted before infecting human beings. We review what is known about the pathogens that emerge, the hosts that they originate in, and the factors that drive their emergence. We discuss challenges to their control and new efforts to predict pandemics, target surveillance to the most crucial interfaces, and identify prevention strategies. New mathematical modelling, diagnostic, communications, and informatics technologies can identify and report hitherto unknown microbes in other species, and thus new risk assessment approaches are needed to identify microbes most likely to cause human disease.

      "\"Potential effects of the combination of nicotinamide, vitamin B2 and vitamin C on oxidative-mediated hepatotoxicity induced by thioacetamideBACKGROUND: The liver disease is one of the most important traditional public health problems in Egypt. Oxidative stress is attributed to such pathological condition that further contributes to the initiation and progression of liver injury. In the present study, we have investigated if the strong antioxidant power of Nicotinamide (NA), Vitamin B2 (VB2), and Vitamin C (VC) can ameliorate TAA-induced oxidative stress-mediated liver injury in the rats. METHODS: Thirty-six albino rats were divided into six groups: Control group; TAA group (IP injection with TAA at a dosage of 200 mg/Kg three times a week for two months); TAA + NA group (rats administered with NA at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily besides TAA as in the control); TAA + VB2 group (rats administered with vitamin B2 at a dosage of 30 mg/kg daily besides injection with TAA); TAA + VC group (rats administered with vitamin C at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily along with injection of TAA). TAA + NA + VB + VC group (rats administered the with the three vitamins daily in TAA pre-injected at the respective doses described above). RESULTS: Treatment of rats with TAA led to a significant elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the serum samples. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline and nitic oxide (NO) were also significantly increased in the TAA-treated rats, while reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly compromised in the hepatic samples. Rats administered with NA, VB2, and VC as individually or in combination ameliorated the deleterious effects of TAA that was confirmed by histopathology. However, the combination of the three vitamins was found more effective as compared to each of the vitamins. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrates that NA, VB2, and VC cross-talk with each other that act as a more potent biochemical chain of antioxidant defense against TAA-induced toxicities in vivo.\"\n",

In Escherichia coli two codon‐specific release factors (RF1 and RF2) direct the termination of protein synthesis, while in eukaryotes a single factor is required. The E. coli factors have been purified and their genes isolated. A combination of protein and DNA sequence data reveal that the RFs are structurally similar and that RF2 is encoded in two reading frames. Frame‐shifting from one reading frame to the next occurs at a rate of 50%, is regulated by the RF2‐specific stop codon UGA, and involves the direct interaction of the RF2 mRNA with the 3’end of the 16S rRNA. The RF genes are located in two separate operons, with the RF1 gene located at 26.7 min and the RF2 gene at 62.3 min on the chromosome map.

Even if benign, they may require a treatment in case of symptoms or cosmetic concerns. In the last years, minimally invasive treatments alternative to surgery have been developed, in particular ultrasound (US) guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods Twenty-four patients (9 males; 15 females; mean age 57.9 years) were treated and divided in two groups (A and B) according to the RFA needle used (18 gauge needle, AMICA; 17 gauge needle, COVIDIEN). Nodules and patients characteristics, together with procedural data were registered pre-treatment and at 1-month follow-up. US visibility of the needle, volume of the nodules, symptoms and cosmetic concerns, complications were registered. Results Visibility of the needle was not significantly different in the two groups (P=0.0787). At 1 month the mean volume of the nodules dropped from 37.1 to 25 mL in group A and from 23.2 to 15.4 mL in group B; shrinkage rate (36.9% and 39.5%, respectively) was not significantly different (P=0.3137). Symptoms decreased from 3.1 to 1.4 in group A and from 4 to 1.6 in group B: no significant differences in reductions were observed (P=0.3305). Cosmetic score decreased from 3.7 to 3.4 in group A and from 3.9 to 3.6 in group B: no significant differences in reductions were observed (P=0.96). Total complication rate (18.2% in group A vs. 23.1% in group B) did not showed significant differences (P=0.5049). Conclusions The two systems used in our study resulted equivalent in terms of US needle visibility, efficacy, symptom/cosmetic relief, safety. More patients and a longer follow-up are necessary to confirm our results.\"\n",

Asthma is a common chronic medical condition in children that is uniquely susceptible to changes brought on by COVID-19. Sudden dramatic changes in the environment, medical practice, and medication use have altered the asthma management landscape with potential impacts on asthma outcomes. In this paper, we review how changes in transportation and travel patterns, school attendance, physical activity, and time spent indoors, along with changes in health care delivery since the start of the pandemic, all play a contributing role in asthma control in children.

We show here that the time evolution of the pandemic doubling time Td(t) is a reliable measure of the efficiency of the Lockdown, case Finding, mobile Tracing (LFT) policy using modern technologies versus the traditional Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG) policy. This goal has been achieved to verify by extracting the time evolution of the doubling time Td(t). The results provide a quantitative measure and make possible predictions on the time evolution of epidemic for different containment policy. Where the lowest s factor, the characteristic time of the exponential growing Td(t) in the arrested regime, was reached by LFT policy also the lowest number of deaths and the shorter time width of the epidemic dome was reached. The record for the largest number of deaths is correlated with the largest s factor in the near threshold regime where no containment measures were taken in time.

      "\"Pulmonary function and bronchial reactivity 4 years after the first virus-induced wheezingBACKGROUND: Wheezing illnesses among young children are common, and are a risk factor for asthma. However, determinants of childhood bronchial reactivity, a key feature of asthma, are largely unknown. Aim of this study was to determine how patient characteristics during the first severe virus-induced wheezing episode are associated with pulmonary function at pre-school age. METHODS: Study consisted of 76 children presenting with their first wheezing episode at the ages of 3 to 23 months. At study entry, viral etiology, rhinovirus genome load, atopic and clinical characteristics, and standardized questionnaire were analyzed. At 4-year follow-up visit, impulse oscillometry with exercise challenge was performed. RESULTS: At study entry, the mean age of the children was 12 months (SD 6.0), 57 (75%) were rhinovirus positive and 22 (30%) were sensitized. At follow-up visit four years later, the mean age of the children was 60 months (SD 7.9) and 37 (49%) were using asthma medication regularly (discontinued before testing in 25 [68%] children). Bronchial reactivity (≥35% change in mean crude values of resistance) after exercise challenge or bronchodilation was present in 9 (12%) children. Children with atopic sensitization at the time of the first wheezing episode were more often likely to develop bronchial reactivity (odds ratio 8.8, P = .03) than the children without sensitization. No other significant associations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Atopic sensitization at the time of the first severe wheezing episode is an important early risk factor for increased bronchial reactivity at pre-school age.\"\n",

Tocilizumab, a drug targeting interleukin-6 administrated in the right timeframe may be beneficial in coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to assess its benefit, drawing from observations in compassionately treated patients. Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, treatment effect (tocilizumab 400mg, single-dose) was assessed using three statistical methods: propensity-score matching, Cox multivariable survival and inverse probability score weighting (IPSW) analyses. Were included all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who presented severity criteria with SpO2<96% despite O2-support >6L/min for more than 6 hours. Were excluded patients in critical care medicine department and those under invasive mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality and ventilation, with a maximum follow-up of 28 days. Results: 246 patients were included (106 treated by tocilizumab). They were 67.6 +/-15.3 years-old, with 95 (38.5%) women. Delay between first symptoms and inclusion was 8.4 +/-4.5 days. Overall, 105 (42.7%) patients presented the primary outcome, with 71 (28.9%) deaths during the 28-days follow-up. Propensity-score-matched 84 pairs of comparable patients. In the matched cohort (n=168), tocilizumab was associated with fewer primary outcomes (hazard ratio (HR)=0.49 (95% confidence interval (95CI)=0.3-0.81), p-value=0.005). These results were similar in the overall cohort (n=246), with Cox multivariable analysis yielding a protective association between tocilizumab and primary outcome (adjusted HR=0.26 (95CI=0.135-0.51, p=0.0001), confirmed by IPSW analysis (p<0.0001). Analyses on mortality with 28-days follow-up yielded similar results. Conclusion: In this retrospective study, tocilizumab single-dose was associated with improved survival without mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19.\"\n",

      "\"Rethinking sustainability: a review of Liberia’s municipal solid waste management systems, status, and challengesThe appalling state of Liberia’s municipal solid waste management system (MSWM) is the motivation for this review and analysis. Solid waste management protocols and system dynamic modeling support policy development as it uses waste prevention to explain the complex waste management systems and suggests methods for effective management. However, creating an effective waste system goes beyond the formulation of policies and legislation; it involves financial and technological proficiency, skilled human capacity, technical, social, resource recycling, educational awareness programs, and active public participation. Because of urbanization, Liberia’s municipal solid waste (MSW) problems have become heightened, thereby impacting the economic, social, and political fabric of society by overburdening infrastructure and social facilities. The impact of urbanization must be addressed because urbanization, amongst several factors, including unsustainable management of MSW, degrades the environment and presents risks to public health. The purpose of this review was to highlight the current waste management activities in Liberia and provide information to the readers about the challenges facing the waste management sector and the challenges impeding the development of a sustainable waste management system. In Liberia, waste management activities are getting worse daily due to shortage of a comprehensive waste management framework, the absence of guidelines regarding the responsibilities of waste generators, and the decision-makers' lack of intent to design and implement a sustainable and integrated management system. Recommendations for collaborative efforts are made by focusing on delivering a waste strategy which concentrates on waste minimization, recycling, resource recovery, and promoting sustainable waste management practices for communities, small businesses, corporations, and government institutions in Liberia and other developing countries.\"\n",

      "\"Long term stability and infectivity of herpesviruses in waterFor viruses to utilize environmental vectors (hard surfaces, soil, water) for transmission, physical and chemical stability is a prerequisite. There are many factors including pH, salinity, temperature, and turbidity that are known to contribute to the ability of viruses to persist in water. Equine herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1) is a pathogenic alphaherpesvirus associated with domestic horses and wild equids. EHV-1 and recombinants of EHV-1 and EHV-9 are able to cause infections in non-equid animal species, particularly in captive settings. Many of the captive non-equid mammals are not naturally sympatric with equids and do not share enclosures, however, in many cases water sources may overlap. Similarly, in the wild, equids encounter many species at waterholes in times of seasonal drought. Therefore, we hypothesized that EHV-1 is stable in water and that water may act as a vector for EHV-1. In order to establish the conditions promoting or hindering EHV-1 longevity, infectivity and genomic stability in water; we exposed EHV-1 to varied water environments (pH, salinity, temperature, and turbidity) in controlled experiments over 21 days. The presence and infectivity of the virus was confirmed by both qPCR and cell culture experiments. Our results show that EHV-1 remains stable and infectious under many conditions in water for up to three weeks.\"\n",

Here we present an ionizable lipid nanoparticle (iLNP) based on iBL0713 lipid for in vitro and in vivo expression of desired proteins using codon-optimized mRNAs. mRNAs encoding luciferase or erythropoietin (EPO) were prepared by in vitro transcription and formulated with proposed iLNP, to form iLP171/mRNA formulations. It was revealed that both luciferase and EPO proteins were successfully expressed by human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and hepatocytes. The maximum amount of protein expression was found at 6 h post-administration. The expression efficiency of EPO with codon-optimized mRNA was significantly higher than that of unoptimized mRNA. Moreover, no toxicity or immunogenicity was observed for these mRNA formulations. Therefore, our study provides a useful and promising platform for mRNA therapeutic development.\"\n",

METHODS: Secondary data were collected from different government organizations, 120 primary surveys were conducted for calculating weights, and results were validated through 12 key people's interviews. Pairwise comparison matrixes were calculated for 9 factors and subfactors. The analytic hierarchy process used for calculating the susceptibility index and map was prepared based on the results. RESULTS: According to the results, multiple causal factors might be responsible for COVID-19 spreading in Bangladesh. Dhaka might be vulnerable to COVID-19 due to a higher population, population density, and international collaboration. According to the pairwise comparison matrix, the consistency ratio for subfactors and factors was in the permissible limit (ie, less than 0.10).

RESULTS (1) Seven hemodialysis patients were diagnosed as SARS clinically and account for 0.24% of total 2885 hemodialysis patients in these units in Beijing. Among the 7 SARS patients, 3 recovered from SARS and 4 died. No case was infected within the hemodialysis units. No SARS case or suspected case was found in the health care workers in hemodialysis units. (2) Additional disinfected measures were carried out in all the hemodialysis units. 98.8% (80/81) of them did not reuse the dialyzer. (3) 98.8% (80/81) of the hemodialysis units developed education about preventing SARS among hemodialysis patients. Before dialysis treatment patients must take temperature, change specific clothes and shoes in over 90% of the hemodialysis units. (4) All health care workers in the hemodialysis units wore hats and gauze masks and 93.7% (74/79) of them wore gloves. Eye shield was worn in 22.8% (18/79) of the dialysis units centers. CONCLUSIONS No ARS case was infected within the hemodialysis units in Beijing. Intensified disinfection of surroundings, self-protection for health care workers and education for patients in personal hygiene habit may be helpful to prevention of SARS in hemodialysis units.\"\n",

      "\"First case of SARS-COV-2 sequencing in cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with suspected demyelinating diseaseThe association between coronaviruses and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions has been previously shown. However, no case has been described of an association between the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) and CNS demyelinating disease so far. SARS-COV-2 was previously detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample of a patient with encephalitis. However, the virus identity was not confirmed by deep sequencing of SARS-COV-2 detected in the CSF. Here, we report a case of a patient with mild respiratory symptoms and neurological manifestations compatible with clinically isolated syndrome. The viral genome of SARS-COV-2 was detected and sequenced in CSF with 99.74–100% similarity between the patient virus and worldwide sequences. This report suggests a possible association of SARS-COV-2 infection with neurological symptoms of demyelinating disease, even in the absence of relevant upper respiratory tract infection signs.\"\n",

      "\"Modeling Citation Trajectories of Scientific PapersSeveral network growth models have been proposed in the literature that attempt to incorporate properties of citation networks. Generally, these models aim at retaining the degree distribution observed in real-world networks. In this work, we explore whether existing network growth models can realize the diversity in citation growth exhibited by individual papers – a new node-centric property observed recently in citation networks across multiple domains of research. We theoretically and empirically show that the network growth models which are solely based on degree and/or intrinsic fitness cannot realize certain temporal growth behaviors that are observed in real-world citation networks. To this end, we propose two new growth models that localize the influence of papers through an appropriate attachment mechanism. Experimental results on the real-world citation networks of Computer Science and Physics domains show that our proposed models can better explain the temporal behavior of citation networks than existing models.\"\n",

      "\"Marine cloud brightening.The idea behind the marine cloud-brightening (MCB) geoengineering technique is that seeding marine stratocumulus clouds with copious quantities of roughly monodisperse sub-micrometre sea water particles might significantly enhance the cloud droplet number concentration, and thereby the cloud albedo and possibly longevity. This would produce a cooling, which general circulation model (GCM) computations suggest could-subject to satisfactory resolution of technical and scientific problems identified herein-have the capacity to balance global warming up to the carbon dioxide-doubling point. We describe herein an account of our recent research on a number of critical issues associated with MCB. This involves (i) GCM studies, which are our primary tools for evaluating globally the effectiveness of MCB, and assessing its climate impacts on rainfall amounts and distribution, and also polar sea-ice cover and thickness; (ii) high-resolution modelling of the effects of seeding on marine stratocumulus, which are required to understand the complex array of interacting processes involved in cloud brightening; (iii) microphysical modelling sensitivity studies, examining the influence of seeding amount, seed-particle salt-mass, air-mass characteristics, updraught speed and other parameters on cloud-albedo change; (iv) sea water spray-production techniques; (v) computational fluid dynamics studies of possible large-scale periodicities in Flettner rotors; and (vi) the planning of a three-stage limited-area field research experiment, with the primary objectives of technology testing and determining to what extent, if any, cloud albedo might be enhanced by seeding marine stratocumulus clouds on a spatial scale of around 100×100 km. We stress that there would be no justification for deployment of MCB unless it was clearly established that no significant adverse consequences would result. There would also need to be an international agreement firmly in favour of such action.\"\n",

      "\"Murine Norovirus 1 (MNV1) Replication Induces Translational Control of the Host by Regulating eIF4E Activity during InfectionProtein synthesis is a tightly controlled process responding to several stimuli, including viral infection. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses depend on the translation machinery of the host and can manipulate it by affecting the availability and function of specific eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Human norovirus is a member of the Caliciviridae family and is responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks. Previous studies on feline calicivirus and murine norovirus 1 (MNV1) demonstrated that the viral protein, genome-linked (VPg), acts to direct translation by hijacking the host protein synthesis machinery. Here we report that MNV1 infection modulates the MAPK pathway to activate eIF4E phosphorylation. Our results show that the activation of p38 and Mnk during MNV1 infection is important for MNV1 replication. Furthermore, phosphorylated eIF4E relocates to the polysomes, and this contributes to changes in the translational state of specific host mRNAs. We propose that global translational control of the host by eIF4E phosphorylation is a key component of the host-pathogen interaction.\"\n",

The relative contribution ratio of each transmission route is largely undetermined, which is affected by environmental conditions, human behavior, the host and the microorganism. In this study, a detailed mathematical model is developed to investigate the relative contributions of different transmission routes to a multi-route transmitted respiratory infection. It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines virus content in droplets, exposure distance, and virus dose transported to the hand of infector. Our multi-route transmission model provides a comprehensive but straightforward method to evaluate the transmission efficiency of different transmission routes of respiratory diseases and provides a basis for predicting the impact of individual level intervention methods such as increasing close-contact distance and wearing protective masks.\"\n",

      "\"Abnormal glycogen in astrocytes is sufficient to cause adult polyglucosan body diseaseAbstract Background A 45-year old woman of Cambodian ethnic background presented with fatal respiratory failure due to a severe diaphragmatic dysfunction. Two years before, she had developed early onset of urinary symptoms. Methods and results Neuroimaging showed atrophy of the spine and medulla as well as a leukodystrophy affecting both supra- and infra-tentorial regions. At autopsy, polyglucosan bodies (PB) were seen in several peripheral tissues, including the diaphragm, and nervous tissues such as peripheral nerves, cerebral white matter, basal ganglia, hippocampus, brainstem and cerebellum. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the brain revealed an exclusive astrocytic localization of the PB. The diagnosis of adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) was confirmed by enzymatic and molecular studies. Conclusion Storage of abnormal glycogen in astrocytes is sufficient to cause the leukodystrophy of APBD. Since brain glycogen is almost exclusively metabolized in astrocytes, this observation sheds light on the pathophysiology of APBD. In addition, this is the first report of an APBD patient presenting with a subacute diaphragmatic failure.\"\n",

According to the time from the disease onset to the cure or from the onset to each CT scan, the total of 30 chest CT scans were divided into 4 stages, namely stage 1 (0-4 days), stage 2 (5-9 days), stage 3 (10-14 days), and stage 4 (over 14 days). A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to quantitatively assess the pulmonary involvement on the basis of the involved area. The differences in chest CT signs and the lung injury scores based on CT findings were compared among the 4 stages.ResultsIn stage 1, ground-glass opacities (GGO) was found frequently in the subpleura, and the CT score was the lowest at 4.00±0.40. Stage 2 was characterized by an increased and mixed density (crazy-paving pattern) with mild consolidation of the lungs, and the CT score reached its peak level of 7.38±3.34 (P < 0.05). In stage 3, an expanded range of consolidation and linear lesions were found in the lungs, and the total CT score averaged 6.86±2.91. In stage 4, a gradual resolution of the consolidation occurred with more linear lesions in the lungs, and the total CT score was 6.21±1.56. The CT scores of the lower lobes were significantly higher compared with those of the middle/upper lobes (P < 0.05) in stage 3 and stage 4.ConclusionChest CT scans allows dynamic monitoring of the changes in the distribution, density and extent of the pulmonary lesions in the 4 stages, which are closely correlated with the evolution of the disease course of COVID-19.\"\n",

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.\"\n",

      "\"γ-Glutamyltranspeptidase is a prognostic marker of survival and recurrence in radiofrequency-ablation treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.PURPOSE Serum γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) level, which is often elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has now been found to be an oxidative stress marker which correlates with inflammation in the extracellular hepatic microenvironment. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of GGT serum levels in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy for the treatment of HCC. METHODS This retrospective study included 254 patients with small liver cancer (tumor of ≤5 cm in diameter and nodule of ≤3 cm) who had been treated with RFA. Baseline serum GGT was examined before therapy, and overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the significance of GGT and other serum markers as prognostic factors. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 27 months, 51 patients had died and 123 had hepatic recurrence. After treatment with RFA, HCC patients with elevated GGT had a shorter OS versus those with normal GGT level (p = 0.001); they also had higher recurrence (p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, albumin (p = 0.003), GGT (p = 0.035), and tumor size (p = 0.027) were independent risk factors for survival, and GGT (p = 0.010) and tumor size (p = 0.026) were significant risk factors for recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Serum GGT is a convenient prognostic biomarker related to OS and recurrence in HCC patients undergoing RFA treatment.\"\n",

      "\"Emergence of a group 3 coronavirus through recombinationAbstract Analyses of turkey coronavirus (TCoV), an enteric disease virus that is highly similar to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) an upper-respiratory tract disease virus in chickens, were conducted to determine the adaptive potential, and genetic changes associated with emergence of this group 3 coronavirus. Strains of TCoV that were pathogenic in poults and nonpathogenic in chickens did not adapt to cause disease in chickens. Comparative genomics revealed two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in IBV with an unidentified sequence likely from another coronavirus, resulting in cross-species transmission and a pathogenicity shift. Following emergence in turkeys, TCoV diverged to different serotypes through the accumulation of mutations within spike. This is the first evidence that recombination can directly lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses and new coronaviral diseases, emphasizing the importance of limiting exposure to reservoirs of coronaviruses that can serve as a source of genetic material for emerging viruses.\"\n",

      "\"MMP9 deficiency does not decrease blood brain barrier disruption, but increases astrocyte MMP3 expression during viral encephalomyelitisExpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP9 correlates with blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption during many neuroinflammatory diseases. During neurotropic coronavirus virus (JHMV) induced encephalomyelitis, MMP9 activity is restricted to neutrophils. Furthermore, myeloid cell depletion implicated MMP9 in facilitating leukocyte central nervous system (CNS) infiltration via loss of BBB integrity. The requirement of MMP9 in BBB disruption was thus assessed in JHMV infected MMP9 deficient (MMP9(−/−)) mice. Depletion of neutrophils reduced CNS accumulation of monocytes and T cells, albeit without affecting overall pathogenesis. By contrast, infected MMP9(−/−) mice revealed no differences in CNS leukocyte infiltration, composition or localization, consistent with BBB disruption similar to wild type (WT) mice. Unimpaired T cell mediated virus control supported an unexpectedly redundant role of MMP9 in promoting leukocyte access to the brain parenchyma. While MMP9 deficiency did not expand the overall limited pattern of MMP expression during JHMV infection, it coincided with MMP3 upregulation. MMP3 expression remained largely confined to astrocytes, similar to WT mice. These data demonstrate that neutrophil-derived MMP9 is not the sole mediator facilitating parenchymal leukocyte entry via BBB disruption during viral encephalomyelitis. Moreover, significantly enhanced MMP3 expression by astrocytes in infected MMP9(−/−) mice suggests an active role of resident cells in participating and potentially collaborating with infiltrating cells in regulating BBB permeability. Overall, these results highlight the complexity of targeting individual MMPs as a strategy to regulate inflammation.\"\n",

      "\"The compromise of virtual screening and its impact on drug discovery.Introduction: Docking and structure-based virtual screening (VS) have been standard approaches in structure-based design for over two decades. However, our understanding of the limitations, potential, and strength of these techniques has enhanced, raising expectations. Areas covered: Based on a survey of reports in the past five years, we assess whether VS: (1) predicts binding poses in agreement with crystallographic data (when available); (2) is a superior screening tool, as often claimed; (3) is successful in identifying chemical scaffolds that can be starting points for subsequent lead optimization cycles. Data shows that knowledge of the target and its chemotypes in postprocessing lead to viable hits in early drug discovery endeavors. Expert opinion: VS is capable of accurate placements in the pocket for the most part, but does not consistently score screening collections accurately. What matters is capitalization on available resources to get closer to a viable lead or optimizable series. Integration of approaches, subjective hit selection guided by knowledge of the receptor or endogenous ligand, libraries driven by experimental guides, validation studies to identify the best docking/scoring that reproduces experimental findings, constraints regarding receptor-ligand interactions, thoroughly designed methodologies, and predefined cutoff scoring criteria strengthen VS's position in pharmaceutical research.\"\n",

It is characterized by a myriad of neuropsychiatric manifestations including mild neurological deficit to severe encephalopathy. PMNS was first described in 1996 and since then there have been 48 cases reported in the English literature. We report another case of PMNS in a 24-year-old healthy male and present a review of the disease entity. METHOD: We searched PMNS-related journal articles and case reports in the English literature, using PubMed and Google search engines. A total of forty-nine cases meeting the diagnostic criteria of PMNS were selected in this review. CONCLUSION: PMNS is a rare complication of severe malaria that might be underreported. It can develop up to 2 months after clearance of parasitemia. Clinical features can be variable. Most cases are self-limited, but more severe cases may benefit from steroid therapy.\"\n",

      "\"An agent-based epidemic model REINA for COVID-19 to identify destructive policiesBackground. Countries have adopted disparate policies in tackling the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. For example, South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts, and many European countries are trying to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or a region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies, i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and should not be implemented. Methods. We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population over time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online. Results. The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). A mitigation strategy aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. A suppression strategy initially consists of the same restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their contacts. The modelling starting point is 2020-02-18. The strategies follow the actual situation until 2020-04-06 and then diverge. The default mitigation scenario with variable 30−40% mobility reduction appears to delay the peak of the epidemic (as intended) but not suppress the disease. In the suppression strategy, active testing and tracing of patients with symptoms and their contacts is implemented in addition to 20−25% mobility reduction. This results in a reduction of the cumulative number of infected individuals from 820 000 to 80 000 and the number of deaths from 6000 to only 640, when compared with the mitigation strategy (during the first year of the epidemic). Discussion. The agent-based model (REINA) can be used to simulate epidemic outcomes for various types of policy actions on a timeline. Our results lend support to the strategy of combining comprehensive testing, contact tracing and targeted isolation measures with social isolation measures. While social isolation is important in the early stages to prevent explosive growth, relying on social isolation alone (the mitigation strategy) appears to be a destructive policy. The open-source nature of the model facilitates rapid further development. The flexibility of the modelling logic supports the future implementation of several already identified refinements in terms of more realistic population models and new types of more specific policy interventions. Improving estimates of epidemic parameters will make it possible to improve modelling accuracy further.\"\n",

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the reinforced cruroplasty during LSG compared with a concurrent group of simple cruroplasty. METHODS The study groups included 96 morbidly obese patients who underwent simultaneous LSG and cruroplasty. Group A: 48 patients with hiatal areal defect <4 cm(2) and normal pillars (simple posterior cruroplasty); group B: 48 patients with hiatal areal defect >4 and <8 cm(2) with weakness of the right pillar (on-lay synthetic absorbable mesh-reinforced cruroplasty). Upper GI symptoms were assessed by Roma III standard questionnaire. Endoscopy, imaging, esophageal 24-h pH monitoring and HR manometry were performed in cases of persistent or recurrent symptoms after surgery. RESULTS Mortality rate was nil. The conversion rate to open was 1 %. Intra-operative diagnosis of hiatal hernia occured in 41 patients (42.7 %). Mesh-related complications were none. Perioperative complications occurred in four patients (4.1 %). After 19- to 21-month follow-up, GERD symptom remission occurred in 89 % of patients. GERD symptoms were detected postoperatively in eight patients: six in group A (five symptomatic and radiological recurrences and one persistent) and two in group B (one persistent and one de novo GERD) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The synthetic absorbable mesh offers an effective option for crural repair during LSG with no clinical recurrences at 19 months. The midterm results of this prospective comparative study evaluating two different technical options for cruroplasty confirm that the simultaneous procedures are safe and cruroplasty is effective in mild-to-moderate GERD control .\"\n",

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city; and to develop a multivariate model to predict the risk of prolonged length of stay in hospital (ProLOS). Methods The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Zhejiang province from January to February 20, 2020. Medical records of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were categorized into the ProLOS and non-ProLOS groups by hospital length of stay greater and less than 14 days, respectively. Conventional descriptive statistics were applied. Multivariate regression model was built to predict the risk of ProLOS, with variables selected using stepwise approach. Results A total of 75 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included for quantitative analysis, including 25 (33%) patients in the ProLOS group. ProLOS patients were more likely to have history of traveling to Wuhan (68% vs. 28%; P=0.002). Patients in the ProLOS group showed lower neutrophil counts [median (IQR): 2.50 (1.77-3.23) ×109/L vs. 2.90 (2.21-4.19) ×109/L; P=0.048], higher partial thrombin time (PT) (13.42±0.63 vs. 13.10±0.48 s; P=0.029), lower D-Dimer [0.26 (0.22-0.46) vs. 0.44 (0.32-0.84) mg/L; P=0.012]. There was no patient died and no severe case in our cohort. The overall LOS was 11 days (IQR, 5-15 days). The median cost for a hospital stay was 7,388.19 RMB (IQR, 5,085.39-11,145.44). The prediction model included five variables of procalcitonin, heart rate, epidemiological history, lymphocyte count and cough. The discrimination of the model was 84.8% (95% CI: 75.3% to 94.4%). Conclusions Our study described clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Wuhan city and found that the illness was less severe than that in the core epidemic region. A multivariate model was developed to predict ProLOS, which showed good discrimination.\"\n",

      "\"Associations of screen work with neck and upper extremity symptoms: a systematic review with meta-analysis.OBJECTIVES It has often been suggested that screen work (ie, work on desktop, laptop, notebook or tablet computers) is a risk factor for neck and upper extremity symptoms. However, an up-to-date overview and quantification of evidence are lacking. We aimed to systematically review the association of exposure to screen work with neck and upper extremity symptoms from prospective studies. METHODS An electronic database search (PubMed, Embase, Cinahl and Scopus) for prospective studies on the association of exposure to screen work and musculoskeletal symptoms was conducted. Studies were synthesised regarding extracted data and risk of bias, and meta-analyses were conducted. RESULTS After screening 3423 unique references, 19 articles from 12 studies (with 18 538 participants) were included for the current review, with the most recent exposure assessment reported in 2005. Studies described duration and input frequency of screen work (ie, computer, keyboard and mouse use, assessed using self-reports or software recordings) and musculoskeletal symptoms (ie, self-reported neck/shoulder and distal upper extremity symptoms and diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome [CTS]). Although there was overall an increased occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms with larger exposure to screen work (relative risk: 1.11 [1.03 1.19]), findings were rather inconsistent with weaker (and statistically non-significant) risks when screen work was assessed by software recording (1.05 [0.91 1.21]) compared to with self-report (1.14 [1.03 1.19]). CONCLUSIONS We found an increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms with screen work. However, the evidence is heterogeneous, and it is striking that it lacks information from contemporary screen work using laptop, notebook or tablet computers.\"\n",

The isolation of the PEDV was successful only in Vero cells maintained in the maintenance medium (MM) containing trypsin. Infected Vero cell cultures exhibited CPE characterized by cell-fusion and syncytial formation, as well as cytoplasmic fluorescence when examined by the indirect immunofluorescent test using rabbit anti-83P-5 virus serum. The isolate was adapted to serial propagation in Vero cell cultures by adding trypsin to MM. Vero cell-adapted PEDV was successfully propagated in the MA104, CPK and ESK cell lines in the presence of trypsin in MM. Vero cell-adapted PEDV had morphologic and physicochemical characteristics similar to those of other members of the coronaviridae. The isolate differed serologically from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis viruses, and no antigenic relationship between the isolate and TGE virus could be detected by the indirect immunofluorescent test. Attempts to isolate PEDV in 6 types of primary fetal pig cell cultures and 6 of 10 established cell lines resulted in the failure, probably because these cells were damaged by the action of trypsin.\"\n",

      "\"Pathological Role of Angiotensin II in Severe COVID-19The activated renin–angiotensin system induces a prothrombotic state resulting from the imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. Angiotensin II is the central effector molecule of the activated renin–angiotensin system and is degraded by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to angiotensin (1–7). The novel coronavirus infection (classified as COVID-19) is caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response that can lead to severe manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death in a proportion of patients, mostly elderly patients with preexisting comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor to enter the target cells, resulting in activation of the renin–angiotensin system. After downregulating the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II is increasingly produced and its counterregulating molecules angiotensin (1–7) reduced. Angiotensin II increases thrombin formation and impairs fibrinolysis. Elevated levels were strongly associated with viral load and lung injury in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, the complex clinical picture of patients with severe complications of COVID-19 is triggered by the various effects of highly expressed angiotensin II on vasculopathy, coagulopathy, and inflammation. Future treatment options should focus on blocking the thrombogenic and inflammatory properties of angiotensin II in COVID-19 patients.\"\n",

A concentration of 40 µg DEAE-D/ml provided maximal enhancement of infection as determined by the time of onset of cytopathic effect (CPE), the percentage of cells infected by the inoculum, and the amount of virus produced. When DEAE-D was used in the inoculum, the CPE appeared a day earlier, the percentage of cells infected by the inoculum, as determined by the fluorescent antibody test, was increased 11 times, and the viral titer was increased 2 times as compared to results obtained without DEAE-D. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus-infected cultures contained much cell-associated virus which could be liberated by sonication to increase the titer of virus stocks. The use of BRSV-infected cells rather than supernates from BRSV-infected cells increased the rate at which a cytopathic effect developed, although it did not substantially increase the titer of virus which was harvested. The use of DEAE-D in the inoculum and the passage of BRSV-infected cells instead of viral suspensions was found to be the quickest and most effective method of consistently obtaining BRSV with a titer of about 10(5.5) TCID(50)/ml.\"\n",

      "\"Healthcare workers' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysisTo estimate the proportion of healthcare workers (HCWs) willing to work during an influenza pandemic and identify associated risk factors, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis compliant with PRISMA guidance. Databases and grey literature were searched to April 2013, and records were screened against protocol eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken using a piloted form. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated (i) pooled proportion of HCWs willing to work and (ii) pooled odds ratios of risk factors associated with willingness to work. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2) statistic, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Data were synthesized narratively where meta-analyses were not possible. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the proportion of HCWs willing to work was abandoned due to excessive heterogeneity (I(2) = 99·2%). Narrative synthesis showed study estimates ranged from 23·1% to 95·8% willingness to work, depending on context. Meta-analyses of specific factors showed that male HCWs, physicians and nurses, full-time employment, perceived personal safety, awareness of pandemic risk and clinical knowledge of influenza pandemics, role-specific knowledge, pandemic response training, and confidence in personal skills were statistically significantly associated with increased willingness. Childcare obligations were significantly associated with decreased willingness. HCWs' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic was moderately high, albeit highly variable. Numerous risk factors showed a statistically significant association with willingness to work despite significant heterogeneity between studies. None of the included studies were based on appropriate theoretical constructs of population behaviour.\"\n",

      "\"A noninvasive method to identify ineffective triggering in patients with noninvasive pressure support ventilation.BACKGROUND Ineffective inspiratory triggering efforts are a major cause of poor patient-ventilator interactions during mechanical ventilation, but their routine identification requires the insertion of an esophageal catheter. OBJECTIVES We developed a mathematical analysis of ventilatory tracings recorded under noninvasive pressure ventilation in order to identify ineffective triggering efforts and their consequences without recording esophageal pressure. METHODS We assessed 2,183 cycles from 44 pressure support tracings in 14 children with cystic fibrosis treated by noninvasive home ventilation. Airway pressure, flow and esophageal pressure time series were visually analyzed and manually counted. Airway pressure versus time and flow versus time were then analyzed using a dedicated algorithm written by us. Esophageal pressure was only used for validation. RESULTS A mathematical treatment of flow time series allowed us to draw phase portraits that had specific periodic trajectories for triggered ventilatory cycles and ineffective triggering efforts. From flow and pressure tracings, our algorithm correctly identified 100% of triggered cycles and 53/56 (94.6%) of ineffective triggering efforts. Ineffective triggering was associated with a significant reduction in minute ventilation, inspiratory flows and a significant increase in inspiratory efforts. CONCLUSIONS A noninvasive analysis of flow and airway pressure can reliably identify ineffective triggering efforts during noninvasive pressure support ventilation. This approach may be a valuable tool for evaluating patient-ventilator interactions and their consequences during long-term recordings.\"\n",

      "\"DO IT Trial: vitamin D Outcomes and Interventions in Toddlers – a TARGet Kids! randomized controlled trialBACKGROUND: Vitamin D levels are alarmingly low (<75 nmol/L) in 65-70% of North American children older than 1 year. An increased risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), asthma-related hospitalizations and use of anti-inflammatory medication have all been linked with low vitamin D. No study has determined whether wintertime vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of URTI and asthma exacerbations, two of the most common and costly illnesses of early childhood. The objectives of this study are: 1) to compare the effect of ‘high dose’ (2000 IU/day) vs. ‘standard dose’ (400 IU/day) vitamin D supplementation in achieving reductions in laboratory confirmed URTI and asthma exacerbations during the winter in preschool-aged Canadian children; and 2) to assess the effect of ‘high dose’ vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D serum levels and specific viruses that cause URTI. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Over 4 successive winters we will recruit 750 healthy children 1–5 years of age. Participating physicians are part of a primary healthcare research network called TARGet Kids!. Children will be randomized to the ‘standard dose’ or ‘high dose’ oral supplemental vitamin D for a minimum of 4 months (200 children per group). Parents will obtain a nasal swab from their child with each URTI, report the number of asthma exacerbations and complete symptom checklists. Unscheduled physician visits for URTIs and asthma exacerbations will be recorded. By May, a blood sample will be drawn to determine vitamin D serum levels. The primary analysis will be a comparison of URTI rate between study groups using a Poisson regression model. Secondary analyses will compare vitamin D serum levels, asthma exacerbations and the frequency of specific viral agents between groups. DISCUSSION: Identifying whether vitamin D supplementation of preschoolers can reduce wintertime viral URTIs and asthma exacerbations and what dose is optimal may reduce population wide morbidity and associated health care and societal costs. This information will assist in determining practice and health policy recommendations related to vitamin D supplementation in healthy Canadian preschoolers.\"\n",

      "\"Risk management of febrile respiratory illness in emergency departments.Febrile Respiratory Illness (FRI) is defined as a new or worsening episode of either cough or shortness of breath, presenting with fever (temperature 38 degrees C or higher) or chills in the previous 24 hours. Some FRI could cause large outbreaks of potentially life-threatening diseases (multi- or extensively drug resistant MTB, SARS, pandemic influenza) if not adequately controlled. Emergency Departments (EDs) are preferential sites of disease transmission because of the presence of both infectious and susceptible patients in the same space, the lack of rapid isolation of infectious patients, and the frequent and close contacts among patients and HCWs often not protected by PPE. The management of risk of FRI transmission is thus extremely important in EDs, where all procedures of infection control should be in place and continually monitored and assessed.

      "\"Evaluation of a systematic approach to weaning of tracheotomized neurological patients: an early interrupted randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND While a systematic approach to weaning reduces the rate of extubation failure in intubated brain-injured patients, no data are available on the weaning outcome of these patients after tracheotomy. We aimed to assess whether a systematic approach to disconnect tracheotomized neurological and neurosurgical patients off the ventilator (intervention) is superior to the sole physician's judgment (control). Based on previous work in intubated patients, we hypothesized a reduction of the rate of failure within 48 h from 15 to 5 %. Secondary endpoints were duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay and mortality. METHODS We designed a single center randomized controlled study. Since no data are available on tracheotomized patients, we based our a priori power analysis on results derived from intubated patients and calculated an overall sample size of 280 patients. RESULTS After inclusion of 168 consecutive patients, the trial was interrupted because the attending physicians judged the observed rate of reconnection to be much greater than expected. The overall rate of failure was 29 %, confirming the physicians' judgment. Twenty-one patients (24 %) in the intervention group and 27 (33 %) controls were reconnected to the ventilator within 48 h (p = 0.222). The main reasons for failure were respiratory distress (80 and 88 % in the treatment and control group, respectively), hemodynamic impairment (15 and 4 % in the treatment and control group, respectively), neurological deterioration (4 % in the control group only). The duration of mechanical ventilation was of 412 ± 202 h and 402 ± 189 h, in the control and intervention group, respectively. ICU length of stay was on average of 23 days for both groups. ICU mortality was 6 % in the control and 2 % in the intervention group without significant differences. CONCLUSION We found no difference between the two groups under evaluation, with a rate of failure much higher than expected. Consequent to the early interruption, our study results to be underpowered. Based on the results of the present study, a further trial should overall enroll 790 patients.

      "\"Effectiveness of treatments for severe sepsis: a prospective, multicenter, observational study.RATIONALE Several Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommendations are reevaluated. OBJECTIVES To analyze the effectiveness of treatments recommended in the sepsis guidelines. METHODS In a prospective observational study, we studied all adult patients with severe sepsis from 77 intensive care units. We recorded compliance with four therapeutic goals (central venous pressure 8 mm Hg or greater for persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, central venous oxygen saturation 70% or greater for persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, blood glucose greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal but less than 150 mg/dl, and inspiratory plateau pressure less than 30 cm H(2)O for mechanically ventilated patients) and four treatments (early broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid challenge in the event of hypotension and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, low-dose steroids for septic shock, drotrecogin alfa [activated] for multiorgan failure). The primary outcome measure was hospital mortality. The effectiveness of each treatment was estimated using propensity scores. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 2,796 patients, 41.6% died before hospital discharge. Treatments associated with lower hospital mortality were early broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (treatment within 1 hour vs. no treatment within first 6 hours of diagnosis; odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.90; P = 0.008) and drotrecogin alfa (activated) (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.84; P = 0.004). Fluid challenge and low-dose steroids showed no benefits. CONCLUSIONS In severe sepsis, early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics in all patients and administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in the most severe patients reduce mortality.\"\n",

      "\"16S rRNA gene sequencing reveals an altered composition of the gut microbiota in chickens infected with a nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virusInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, causes serious losses to the poultry industry. Intestinal microbiota play an important role in chicken health and contribute to the defence against colonization by invading pathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between the intestinal microbiome and nephropathogenic IBV (NIBV) infection. Initially, chickens were randomly distributed into 2 groups: the normal group (INC) and the infected group (IIBV). The ilea were collected for morphological assessment, and the ileal contents were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The results of the IIBV group analyses showed a significant decrease in the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05), while the goblet cells increased compared to those in the INC group. Furthermore, the microbial diversity in the ilea decreased and overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae and underrepresentation of Chloroplast and Clostridia was found in the NIBV-infected chickens. In conclusion, these results showed that the significant separation of the two groups and the characterization of the gut microbiome profiles of the chickens with NIBV infection may provide valuable information and promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of this disease.\"\n",

      "\"Pathobiological and Genomic Characterization of a Cold-Adapted Infectious Bronchitis Virus (BP-caKII)We established a cold-adapted infectious bronchitis virus (BP-caKII) by passaging a field virus through specific pathogen-free embryonated eggs 20 times at 32 °C. We characterized its growth kinetics and pathogenicity in embryonated eggs, and its tropism and persistence in different tissues from chickens; then, we evaluated pathogenicity by using a new premature reproductive tract pathogenicity model. Furthermore, we determined the complete genomic sequence of BP-caKII to understand the genetic changes related to cold adaptation. According to our results, BP-caKII clustered with the KII genotype viruses K2 and KM91, and showed less pathogenicity than K2, a live attenuated vaccine strain. BP-caKII showed delayed viremia, resulting in its delayed dissemination to the kidneys and cecal tonsils compared to K2 and KM91, the latter of which is a pathogenic field strain. A comparative genomics study revealed similar nucleotide sequences between BP-caKII, K2 and KM91 but clearly showed different mutations among them. BP-caKII shared several mutations with K2 (nsp13, 14, 15 and 16) following embryo adaptation but acquired multiple additional mutations in nonstructural proteins (nsp3, 4 and 12), spike proteins and nucleocapsid proteins following cold adaptation. Thus, the establishment of BP-caKII and the identified mutations in this study may provide insight into the genetic background of embryo and cold adaptations, and the attenuation of coronaviruses.\"\n",

In addition, we report about COVID-19 in health workers in Malaysia. Claims for occupational diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 are recorded separately in a database of the Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention in the Health and Welfare Services (BGW). This database is analyzed according to its content as of May 22, 2020. In addition, the notifiable cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections from personnel in medical institutions (e.g., clinics and doctor's office) and social welfare institutions (e.g., nursing homes, shelters and refugee camps) following the German Infection Protection Act are analyzed. The report from Malaysia is based on personal experience and publications of the government. In Germany at present, 4398 suspected case reports for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections among health and social workers have been filed. This figure is four times the number of all reported infections normally received per year. The majority of claims, regardless of being a confirmed infection, concerned nurses (n = 6927, 63.9%). The mortality rate for workers infected with SARS-CoV-2 is 0.2% to 0.5%. Doctors are affected by severe illness more frequently than other occupational groups (8.1% vs. 4.1%). In Malaysia, work-related infection of health workers (HW) occurred mainly when COVID-19 was not suspected in patients and no adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn. Although knowledge on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among workers remains limited, the impact appears to be substantial. This is supported by the mortality rate among infected workers. Occupational health check-ups carried out at the present time should be systematically analyzed in order to gain more information on the epidemiology of COVID-19 among HW. Since the supply and use of PPE improved, the infection risk of HW in Malaysia seems to have decreased.\"\n",

Methods: Literature on novel coronavirus pneumonia was retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE databases. The relevant data was extracted and a meta-analysis was performed using StatsDirect statistical software V.2.8.0 to calculate the combined odds ratio. Results: Seven studies were included, consisting of 1594 cases. The meta-analysis result showed that the most common clinical symptoms of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were fever (91.6%) and cough (64.5%), followed by dyspnea (32.8%) and sputum (28.1%). Headache (10.5%), sore throat (11.2%), hemoptysis (3.2%), diarrhea (6.6%) and the other symptoms were relatively rare. Aspartate aminotransferase (29%), alanine transaminase (22.7%), and total bilirubin (11.7%) levels were elevated, except for serum albumin levels (80.4%). The common therapeutic agents used were antibiotics (87.7%), antiviral drugs (75.5%), and glucocorticoids (26.6%), while antifungal agents (7.7%) were used in few. Mechanical ventilation (13.4%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (1.9%), and continuous renal replacement therapy (3.8%) were used in severe cases. The rate of mortality in hospital was 7.7%, respectively. Heterogeneity between studies was significant; however, subgroup and sensitivity analysis had failed to identify clear sources of heterogeneity. Conclusion: Fever, cough and liver dysfunction are the main clinical manifestations of this disease and the mortality rate is low.\"\n",

      "\"IRAK-M alters the polarity of macrophages to facilitate the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosisBACKGROUND: Intracellular bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), infects specifically macrophages as host cells. IRAK-M, a member of IRAK family, is a negative regulator in TLR signaling and specifically expresses in monocytes and macrophages. The role of IRAK-M in intracellular growth of M. tb and macrophage polarization was explored, for deeply understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb, the significance of IRAK-M to innate immunity and pathogen-host interaction. METHODS: IRAK-M expression was detected in M. tb infected macrophages and in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis with immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. IRAK-M knock-down and over-expressing cell strains were constructed and intracellular survival of M. tb was investigated by acid-fast staining and colony forming units. Molecular markers of M1-type (pSTAT1 and iNOS) and M2-type (pSTAT6 and Arg-1) macrophages were detected using Western blot in IRAK-M knockdown U937 cells infected with M. tb H37Rv. U937 cells were stimulated with immunostimulant CpG7909 into M1 status and then infected with M. tb H37Rv. Expression of IRAK-M, IRAK-4 and iNOS was detected with immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, to evaluate the effect of IRAK-M to CpG directed M1-type polarization of macrophages during M. tb infection. Molecules related with macrophage’s bactericidal ability such as Hif-1 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were detected with immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: IRAK-M increased in M. tb infected macrophage cells and also in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis. IRAK-M over-expression resulted in higher bacterial load, while IRAK-M interference resulted in lower bacterial load in M. tb infected cells. During M. tb infection, IRAK-M knockdown induced M1-type, while inhibited M2-type polarization of macrophage. M1-type polarization of U937 cells induced by CpG7909 was inhibited by M. tb infection, which was reversed by IRAK-M knockdown in U937 cells. IRAK-M affected Hif-1 and MAPK signaling cascade during M. tb infection. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, IRAK-M might alter the polarity of macrophages, to facilitate intracellular survival of M. tb and affect Th1-type immunity of the host, which is helpful to understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb.\"\n",

In 85% of confirmed SARS cases (n = 20), the S2 recombinant fragment based WB was positive and this was comparable to the commercial ELISA using heat killed SARS-CoV. WB using the other four recombinant fragments in confirmed SARS cases generated lower rates of detection (S1—75%, S1-N—25%, S1-C—55%). Evaluation of sera from healthy controls (n = 60) resulted in two weakly positive ELISA results with the remainder being negative while the S2 protein WB demonstrated three positive results from the 20 controls with a history of SARS contact and no positive results in 40 noncontact controls. A discrepancy between the ELISA and S2 WB arose when evaluating per-2003 sera from individuals (n = 10) with SARS-like symptoms (ELISA—100% positive, S2 WB—30% positive). These data suggest that the S2 WB assay may be particularly useful in ELISA-negative SARS cases and in some ELISA-positive non-SARS cases.\"\n",

A novel FBoV HRB2015-LDF was first identiﬁed from the cat with severe enteritis in Northeast China, with an overall positive rate of 2.78% (1/36). Phylogenetic and homologous analysis of the complete genome showed that FBoV HRB2015-LDF was clustered into the FBoV branch and closely related to other FBoVs, with 68.7–97.5% identities. And the genes of VP1, NPA and NS1 shared 70.7–97.6, 72.4–98.6 and 67.2–98.0% nucleotide identities with other FBoVs, respectively. The results suggested that the FBoVs could be divided into two distinct lineages, and the difference of nucleotide identities was >20–30% between the lineages.\"\n",

      "\"Prolonged nasal eosinophilia in all_ergic patients after common coldBackground: Viral respiratory tract infections may cause both harmless common colds and severe asthma exacerbations; the differences in disease expression probably depend on the all_ergic status of the patient. To determine whether altered immunologic mechanisms underlie these differences, we investigated nasal inflammation during naturall_y acquired common cold. Methods: In a group of 16 patients (eight all_ergic), nasal brush samples were taken, and nasal symptoms were recorded during common cold, 2 weeks later (convalescence), and at baseline (>4 weeks without nasal symptoms). Nasal brush cells were stained immunohistochemicall_y for Langerhans cells, T cells, monocytes, neutrophils, B cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, eosinophils, eotaxin, and RANTES. Results: Four rhinovirus, four coronavirus, three RSV, one Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and one influenza A/enterovirus double infection were confirmed. Increased numbers of T cells, monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, eosinophils, and RANTES‐ and eotaxin‐positive cells, but not neutrophils, were observed during common cold in all_ergic and nonall_ergic patients, and increased numbers of mast cells in all_ergic patients. Compared to nonall_ergic patients, in all_ergic patients eosinophil influx persisted into convalescence. Conclusions: Prolonged nasal eosinophil influx was observed in all_ergic patients after common cold. What immunologic factors can induce prolonged eosinophil influx and whether this may increase the risk of subsequent all_ergen‐induced hypersensitivity reactions must be studied further.\"\n",

      "\"Neurological manifestations and COVID-19: Experiences from a tertiary care center at the FrontlineOBJECTIVE: To report neurological manifestations seen in patients hospitalized with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a large academic medical center in Chicago, Illinois. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data records of 50 patients with COVID-19 who were evaluated by the neurology services from March 1, 2020 - April 30, 2020. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on timing of developing neurological manifestations: the \"Neuro first\" group had neurological manifestations upon initial assessment, and the \"COVID first\" group developed neurological symptoms greater than 24 h after hospitalization. The demographics, comorbidities, disease severity and neurological symptoms and diagnoses of both groups were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients (48% African American and 24% Latino) were included in the analysis. Most common neurological manifestations observed were encephalopathy (n = 30), cerebrovascular disease (n = 20), cognitive impairment (n = 13), seizures (n = 13), hypoxic brain injury (n = 7), dysgeusia (n = 5), and extraocular movement abnormalities (n = 5). The \"COVID-19 first\" group had more evidence of physiologic disturbances on arrival with a more severe/critical disease course (83.3% vs 53.8%, p 0.025). CONCLUSION: Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 are highly variable and can occur prior to the diagnosis of or as a complication of the viral infection. Despite similar baseline comorbidities and demographics, the COVID-19 patients who developed neurologic symptoms later in hospitalization had more severe disease courses. Differently from previous studies, we noted a high percentage of African American and Latino individuals in both groups.\"\n",

Polymicrobial infection is common and, due to the difficulties in confirming the etiology of pneumonia, empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is frequently used. Areas covered: The author based this article on literature identified from PubMed. The author's search terms included: pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, HIV, children. The articles reviewed included original studies, recent review articles and current guidelines on the management of pneumonia in HIV-infected children. The microbiological etiology and the empiric and pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants and children are also discussed. Expert opinion: There are many changing epidemiological factors impacting antimicrobial management of community-acquired pneumonia in the context of HIV infection in infants and children. These include vaccination strategies, antimicrobial prophylaxis, emerging drug-resistant pathogens, and recognition of the importance of viruses and tuberculosis in the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia. Further research is needed on optimal amtimicrobial management strategies in HIV-exposed uninfected children, and HIV-infected children receiving antiretroviral therapy.\"\n",

      "\"Chapter Five Pleiotropic Roles of Type 1 Interferons in Antiviral Immune ResponsesAbstract Since Isaac's and Lindenmann's seminal experiments over 50 years ago demonstrating a soluble factor generated from heat killed virus-stimulated chicken embryos could inhibit live influenza virus replication, the term interferon has been synonymous with inhibition of virus replication. While the antiviral properties of type 1 interferon (IFN-I) are undeniable, recent studies have reported expanding and somewhat unexpected roles of IFN-I signaling during both acute and persistent viral infections. IFN-I signaling can promote morbidity and mortality through induction of aberrant inflammatory responses and recruitment of inflammatory innate immune cell populations during acute respiratory viral infections. During persistent viral infection, IFN-I signaling promotes containment of early viral replication/dissemination, however, also initiates and maintains immune suppression, lymphoid tissue disorganization, and CD4 T cell dysfunction through modulation of multiple immune cell populations. Finally, new data are emerging illuminating how specific IFN-I species regulate immune pathology and suppression during acute and persistent viral infections, respectively. Systematic characterization of the cellular populations that produce IFN-I, how the timing of IFN-I induction and intricacies of subtype specific IFN-I signaling promote pathology or immune suppression during acute and persistent viral infections should inform the development of treatments and modalities to control viral associated pathologies.\"\n",

      "\"Silk fibroin-Pellethane® cardiovascular patches: Effect of silk fibroin concentration on vascular remodeling in rat model.Life-threatening cardiovascular anomalies require surgery for structural repair with cardiovascular patches. The biomaterial patch, derived from Bombyx mori silk fibroin (SF), is used as an alternative material due to its excellent tissue affinity and biocompatibility. However, SF lacks the elastomeric characteristics required for a cardiovascular patch. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we combined the thermoplastic polyurethane, Pellethane® (PU) with SF to develop an elastic biocompatible patch. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the blended SF/PU patch in a vascular model. Additionally, we focused on the effects of different SF concentrations in the SF/PU patch on its biological and physical properties. Three patches of different compositions (SF, SF7PU3 and SF4PU6) were created using an electrospinning method. Each patch type (n = 18) was implanted into rat abdominal aorta and histopathology was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-implantation. The results showed that with increasing SF content the tensile strength and elasticity decreased. Histological evaluation revealed that inflammation gradually decreased in the SF7PU3 and SF patches throughout the study period. At 6 months post-implantation, the SF7PU3 patch demonstrated progressive remodeling, including significantly higher tissue infiltration, elastogenesis and endothelialization compared with SF4PU6. In conclusion, an increase of SF concentration in the SF/PU patch had effects on vascular remodeling and physical properties. Moreover, our blended patch might be an attractive alternative material that could induce the growth of a neo-artery composed of tissue present in native artery.\"\n",

Clinical manifestations occur shortly after exposure, or a few days later. There is controversy regarding the transmission of the virus through the tear and conjunctiva; however, there are reports that the ocular surface might be a potential target for COVID-19. The ease of transmission of this virus at close proximity presents a risk to eyecare workers. Several recommendations have been issued by local and national organizations to address the issue of safe ophthalmic practice during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These guidelines have numerous similarities; however, subtle differences exist. The purpose of this paper was to discuss measures, with a specific focus on standard precautions, to prevent further dissemination of COVID-19 at Eye Clinics.

      "\"Primary severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection limits replication but not lung inflammation upon homologous rechallenge.Our knowledge regarding immune-protective and immunopathogenic events in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection is limited, and little is known about the dynamics of the immune response at the primary site of disease. Here, an African green monkey (AGM) model was used to elucidate immune mechanisms that facilitate viral clearance but may also contribute to persistent lung inflammation following SARS-CoV infection. During primary infection, SARS-CoV replicated in the AGM lung for up to 10 days. Interestingly, lung inflammation was more prevalent following viral clearance, as leukocyte numbers peaked at 14 days postinfection (dpi) and remained elevated at 28 dpi compared to those of mock-infected controls. Lung macrophages but not dendritic cells were rapidly activated, and both cell types had high activation marker expression at late infection time points. Lung proinflammatory cytokines were induced at 1 to 14 dpi, but most returned to baseline by 28 dpi except interleukin 12 (IL-12) and gamma interferon. In SARS-CoV homologous rechallenge studies, 11 of the 12 animals were free of replicating virus at day 5 after rechallenge. However, incidence and severity of lung inflammation was not reduced despite the limited viral replication upon rechallenge. Evaluating the role of antibodies in immune protection or potentiation revealed a progressive increase in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in lung and serum that did not correlate temporally or spatially with enhanced viral replication. This study represents one of the first comprehensive analyses of lung immunity, including changes in leukocyte populations, lung-specific cytokines, and antibody responses following SARS-CoV rechallenge in AGMs.\"\n",

      "\"Relational Metric Learning with Dual Graph Attention Networks for Social RecommendationExisting social recommenders typically incorporate all social relations into user preference modeling, while social connections are not always built on common interests. In addition, they often learn a single vector for each user involved in two domains, which is insufficient to reveal user’s complex interests to both items and friends. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we consider modeling the user-item interactions and social relations simultaneously and propose a novel metric learning-based model called RML-DGATs. Specifically, relations in two domains are modeled as two types of relation vectors, with which each user can be regarded as being translated to both multiple item-aware and social-aware representations. Then we model the relation vectors by neighborhood interactions with two carefully designed dual GATs to fully encode the neighborhood information. Finally, the two parts are jointly trained under a dual metric learning framework. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the best baseline by 1.91% to 4.74% on three metrics for top-N recommendation and the performance gains are more significant under the cold-start scenarios.\"\n",

      "\"Cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoproteins and insights into coronavirus evolutionA new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% identity) to that of bat α-coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus spikes. The results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV and β-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses.\"\n",

      "\"Retained transcranial knife blade with transection of the internal carotid artery treated by staged endovascular and surgical therapy: technical case report.BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE We describe the use of proximal and distal endovascular coil embolization of the internal carotid artery followed by operative removal of a retained foreign object transecting the petrocavernous portion of the internal carotid artery. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 20-year-old man sustained a stab wound to the left temporal skull and presented with a retained knife blade. He reported a headache at presentation, but remained neurologically intact with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. Computed tomography imaging and subsequent angiography confirmed complete transection of the petrocavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery with effective tamponade by the knife blade in situ and satisfactory collateral flow across the Circle of Willis. Coil embolization of the left internal carotid artery was performed. Retrograde embolization of the petrocavernous internal carotid segment distal to the injury was performed via vertebral and posterior communicating artery access. Antegrade embolization of the internal carotid artery proximal to the injury was completed and the patient was transferred to the operating room for craniectomy and foreign body extraction. Postoperative computed tomography angiography revealed no parenchymal hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift, and successful embolization of the internal carotid artery. At 6-week follow-up, the patient remained neurologically intact with no infectious or vascular complications. CONCLUSION Staged endovascular and surgical therapy provides complete assessment and effective control of damaged vessels when retained intracranial foreign bodies are present. Given the high risk of vascular injury with retained transcranial foreign bodies, this strategy should be considered a safe approach for these challenging cases.\"\n",

      "\"Replication of MERS and SARS coronaviruses in bat cells offers insights to their ancestral originsPrevious findings of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-related viruses in bats, and the ability of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 spike protein to utilize MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hDPP4, suggest a bat ancestral origin of MERS-CoV. We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5 and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P=0.0174), supporting that DPP4 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin.\"\n",

      "\"Down-regulation of transcription of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 in cultured astrocytes by murine coronavirus infectionAbstract Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes encephalitis and demyelination in the central nervous system of susceptible rodents. Astrocytes are the major target for MHV persistence. However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes survive MHV infection and permit viral persistence are not known. Here we performed DNA microarray analysis on differential gene expression in astrocyte DBT cells by MHV infection and found that the mRNA of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 was significantly decreased following MHV infection. This finding was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and BNip3-promoter-luciferase reporter system. Interestingly, infection with live and ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses equally repressed BNip3 expression, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression does not require virus replication and is mediated during cell entry. Furthermore, treatment of cells with chloroquine, which blocks the acidification of endosomes, significantly inhibited the repression of the BNip3 promoter activity induced by the acidic pH-dependent MHV mutant OBLV60, which enters cells via endocytosis, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression is mediated by fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes during entry. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence between nucleotides 262 and 550 of the 588-base-pair BNip3 promoter is necessary and sufficient for driving the BNip3 expression and that it contains signals that are responsible for MHV-induced down-regulation of BNip3 expression in DBT cells. These results may provide insights into the mechanisms by which MHV evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival, thereby allowing its persistence in the host astrocytes.\"\n",

      "\"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid detection of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium, which causes algal blooms and poisoning of shellfishThe marine dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium includes a number of species that produce potent neurotoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning, which in humans may cause muscular paralysis, neurological symptoms and, in extreme cases, death. Because of the genetic diversity of different genera and species, molecular tools may help to detect the presence of target microorganisms in marine field samples. Here we employed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for the rapid and simple detection of toxic Alexandrium species. A set of four primers were designed based upon the conserved region of the 5.8S rRNA gene of members of the genus Alexandrium. Using this detection system, toxic Alexandrium genes were amplified and visualized as a ladder-like pattern of bands on agarose gels under isothermal condition within 60 min. The LAMP amplicons were also directly visualized by eye in the reaction tube by the addition of SYBR Green I. This LAMP assay was 10-fold more sensitive than a conventional PCR method with a detection limit of 5 cells per tube when targeting DNA from Alexandrium minutum. The LAMP assay reported here indicates the potential usefulness of the technique as a valuable simple, rapid alternative procedure for the detection of target toxic Alexandrium species during coastal water monitoring.\"\n",

      "\"Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock, 2012OBJECTIVE: To provide an update to the “Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,” last published in 2008. DESIGN: A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development. METHODS: The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations. RESULTS: Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a Pao (2)/Fio (2) ratio of ≤100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao (2)/Fi o (2) <150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are >180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven “absolute”’ adrenal insufficiency (2C). CONCLUSIONS: Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

      "\"Spatio-Temporal Patterns of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic at the County Level in Hubei Province, ChinaUnderstanding the spatio-temporal characteristics or patterns of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic is critical in effectively preventing and controlling this epidemic. However, no research analyzed the spatial dependency and temporal dynamics of 2019-nCoV. Consequently, this research aims to detect the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2019-nCoV epidemic using spatio-temporal analysis methods at the county level in Hubei province. The Mann–Kendall and Pettitt methods were used to identify the temporal trends and abrupt changes in the time series of daily new confirmed cases, respectively. The local Moran’s I index was applied to uncover the spatial patterns of the incidence rate, including spatial clusters and outliers. On the basis of the data from January 26 to February 11, 2020, we found that there were 11 areas with different types of temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases. The pattern characterized by an increasing trend and abrupt change is mainly attributed to the improvement in the ability to diagnose the disease. Spatial clusters with high incidence rates during the period were concentrated in Wuhan Metropolitan Area due to the high intensity of spatial interaction of the population. Therefore, enhancing the ability to diagnose the disease and controlling the movement of the population can be confirmed as effective measures to prevent and control the regional outbreak of the epidemic.\"\n",

However, the resurgence of pathogenic diseases in different parts of the world has revealed the importance of identifying novel, rapid, and concrete solutions for control and prevention. Edible vaccines pose an interesting alternative that could overcome some of the constraints of traditional vaccines. The term “edible vaccine” refers to the use of edible parts of a plant that has been genetically modified to produce specific components of a particular pathogen to generate protection against a disease. The aim of this review is to present and critically examine “edible vaccines” as an option for global immunization against pathogenic diseases and their outbreaks and to discuss the necessary steps for their production and control and the list of plants that may already be used as edible vaccines.

The aim of this selected population study was to investigate virus etiology, atopic characteristics, and illness severity, as well as their interrelation, among first‐time wheezing children. METHODS: We studied 111 first‐time wheezing children aged between 3 and 23 months (88/23 in‐/outpatients). The investigated factors included atopy, food, perennial and aeroallergen sensitization, eczema, atopic eczema, elevated blood eosinophil count, and parental allergic rhinitis, asthma, and smoking. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for adenovirus, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, bocavirus‐1 (also serologically confirmed), influenza viruses, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus using PCR methods. RESULTS: The mean age of the study patients was 12 months (standard deviation 6.0). Atopic characteristics could be found in 56%, atopic eczema in 16%, and sensitization in 23% of the cases. In all samples (100%), ≥1 viruses were detected as follows: rhinovirus (76%), respiratory syncytial virus (29%), bocavirus (18%, acute infections), and other viruses <10% each. Virus coinfections occurred in 38% of the children. Rhinovirus infection was positively associated with age, blood eosinophil count, eczema, and duration of cough, as well as parental allergic rhinitis and smoking but negatively associated with virus coinfection (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A respiratory virus infection can be detected in all first‐time wheezing children. Rhinovirus dominated the findings and was linked to atopic characteristics, prolonged cough, and parental smoking.\"\n",

Little is known about safety of drug combinations using two nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors in patients with HCV associated advanced cirrhosis. Here, we report frequent occurrence of lactic acidosis associated with acute-on-chronic hepatic decompensation during ribavirin (RBV) plus SOF based antiviral therapy. METHODS Thirty-five patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis, compensated cirrhosis, and decompensated cirrhosis without and after liver transplantation were treated with SOF based antiviral therapy with and without RBV. Adverse events including lactic acidosis (pH <7.35, lactate >20 mg/dl) were recorded 24 weeks before and during (mean ±SD, 18±11 weeks) antiviral therapy. Efficacy was determined by assessment of serum HCV RNA. RESULTS We observed severe adverse events in 15/35 (43%) patients before (24 weeks) and in 12/35 (34%) patients during antiviral therapy, the majority in association with acute-on-chronic hepatic decompensation. Lactic acidosis occurred in 5/35 (14%) patients during therapy, while no event of lactic acidosis was observed prior to therapy. Lactic acidosis was associated with hepatic decompensation including renal failure and infection, and was severe (pH <7.3) in two patients. CONCLUSIONS RBV in combination with SOF based antiviral therapy in patients with HCV associated advanced cirrhosis may be associated with the development of lactic acidosis. Impaired renal function, and higher MELD/Child-Pugh scores were identified as potential risk factors.\"\n",

      "\"Assisted mechanical ventilation: the future is now!Assisted ventilation is a highly complex process that requires an intimate interaction between the ventilator and the patient. The complexity of this form of ventilation is frequently underappreciated by the bedside clinician. In assisted mechanical ventilation, regardless of the specific mode, the ventilator's gas delivery pattern and the patient's breathing pattern must match near perfectly or asynchrony between the patient and the ventilator occurs. Asynchrony can be categorized into four general types: flow asynchrony; trigger asynchrony; cycle asynchrony; and mode asynchrony. In an article recently published in BMC Anesthesiology, Hodane et al. have demonstrated reduced asynchrony during assisted ventilation with Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) as compared to pressure support ventilation (PSV). These findings add to the growing volume of data indicating that modes of ventilation that provide proportional assistance to ventilation - e.g., NAVA and Proportional Assist Ventilation (PAV) - markedly reduce asynchrony. As it becomes more accepted that the respiratory center of the patient in most circumstances is the most appropriate determinant of ventilatory pattern and as the negative outcome effects of patient-ventilator asynchrony become ever more recognized, we can expect NAVA and PAV to become the preferred modes of assisted ventilation!\"\n",

OBJECTIVE To assess the visual outcomes, the obliteration rate, and the need for retreatment of OSA treated by the pipeline embolization device (PED). METHODS Patients who underwent treatment with PED for OSA from 2009 to 2014 were selected and retrospectively reviewed. Patient's age, sex, mode of presentation, and aneurysm size were recorded. The complication rates, the need for retreatment (due to recurrence of the aneurysm or worsening symptoms), the aneurysm occlusion rates, the evolution of visual symptoms, and the evolution of headache/retro-orbital pain were registered. RESULTS Forty-one patients harboring 44 OSA treated by flow-diversion were identified. Females constituted 87.80% (37/41) of the cohort. The mean age was 59.16 ± 12.54 years. At final angiographic follow-up, 77.27% (34/44) had complete occlusion, 6.81% (3/44) had near-complete occlusion, and 15.90% (7/44) had incomplete occlusion. Of the 22 symptomatic OSA, complete resolution or significant improvement was noted in 72.72% (16/22), while worsening of symptoms occurred in 4.54% (1/22). Five patients out of 22 (22.72%; 5/22) had no significant changes in their symptoms. The complication rate was 2.27% (1/44). The mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSION The low complication rate, the high obliteration rate, and the high rate of improvement in the visual symptoms make flow-diversion an appealing option for the treatment of OSA.\"\n",

Emergency physicians are at risk for infection during invasive procedures, and the respirators can reduce this risk. This study aimed to determine whether endotracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopes affected protection performances of respirators. Methods. A randomized crossover study of 24 emergency physicians was performed. We performed quantitative fit tests using respirators (cup type, fold type without a valve, and fold type with a valve) before and during intubation. The primary outcome was respirators' fit factors (FF), and secondary outcomes were acceptable protection (percentage of scores above 100 FF [FF%]). Results. 24 pieces of data were analyzed. Compared to fold-type respirator without a valve, FF and FF% values were lower when participants wore a cup-type respirator (200 FF [200-200] versus 200 FF [102.75–200], 100% [78.61–100] versus 74.16% [36.1–98.9]; all P < 0.05) or fold-type respirator with a valve (200 FF [200-200] versus 142.5 FF [63.50–200], 100% [76.10–100] versus 62.50% [8.13–100]; all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in intubation time and success rate according to respirator types. Conclusions. Motion during endotracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopes influenced the protective performance of some respirators. Therefore, emergency physicians should identify and wear respirators that provide the best personalized fit for intended tasks.\"\n",

      "\"Seneca Valley Virus 3C protease negatively regulates the type I interferon pathway by acting as a viral deubiquitinaseAbstract The mechanisms that enable Seneca Valley Virus (SVV) to escape the host innate immune response are not well known. Previous studies demonstrated that SVV 3Cpro suppresses innate immune responses by cleavage of host proteins and degradation of IRF3 and IRF7 protein expression. Here, we showed that SVV 3C protease (3Cpro) has deubiquitinating activity. Overexpressed 3Cpro inhibits the ubiquitination of cellular substrates, acting on both lysine-48- and lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. SVV infection also possessed deubiquitinating activity. The ubiquitin-proteasome system was significantly involved in SVV replication. Furthermore, 3Cpro inhibited the ubiquitination of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), thereby blocking the expression of interferon (IFN)-β and IFN stimulated gene 54 (ISG54) mRNAs. A detailed analysis revealed that mutations (H48A, C160A, or H48A/C160A) that ablate the Cys and His residues of 3Cpro abrogated its deubiquitinating activity and the ability of 3Cpro to block IFN-β induction. Together, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism developed by SVV 3Cpro to promote viral replication, and may also provide a novel strategy for improving ubiquitination-based therapy.\"\n",

We report the duration of viral detection in throat and rectum of a COVID-19 patient treated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively. Because live SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully isolated from a stool sample from a COVID-19 patient in China, the results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients may remain infectious for long periods, and fecal-oral transmission may be possible. Therefore, our finding has important implications for infection control.\"\n",

      "\"Pregnancy physiology pattern prediction study (4P study): protocol of an observational cohort study collecting vital sign information to inform the development of an accurate centile-based obstetric early warning score.INTRODUCTION Successive confidential enquiries into maternal deaths in the UK have identified an urgent need to develop a national early warning score (EWS) specifically for pregnant or recently pregnant women to aid more timely recognition, referral and treatment of women who are developing life-threatening complications in pregnancy or the puerperium. Although many local EWS are in use in obstetrics, most have been developed heuristically. No current obstetric EWS has defined the thresholds at which an alert should be triggered using evidence-based normal ranges, nor do they reflect the changing physiology that occurs with gestation during pregnancy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS An observational cohort study involving 1000 participants across three UK sites in Oxford, London and Newcastle. Pregnant women will be recruited at approximately 14 weeks' gestation and have their vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and temperature) measured at 4 to 6-week intervals during pregnancy. Vital signs recorded during labour and delivery will be extracted from hospital records. After delivery, participants will measure and record their own vital signs daily for 2 weeks. During the antenatal and postnatal periods, vital signs will be recorded on an Android tablet computer through a custom software application and transferred via mobile internet connection to a secure database. The data collected will be used to define reference ranges of vital signs across normal pregnancy, labour and the immediate postnatal period. This will inform the design of an evidence-based obstetric EWS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study has been approved by the NRES committee South East Coast-Brighton and Sussex (14/LO/1312) and is registered with the ISRCTN (10838017). All participants will provide written informed consent and can withdraw from the study at any point. All data collected will be managed anonymously. The findings will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed journals and through research conferences.\"\n",

      "\"Developmental Regulation of Angiotensinogen Gene Expression in SheepABSTRACT: It has been suggested that the liver is not the main source of angiotensinogen during fetal life in rats, but that the kidney is an important site of fetal angiotensinogen synthesis. In an effort to determine if this phenomenon is specific to the rat or applicable to other species, we compared the ontogenic changes in hepatic and renal angiotensinogen mRNA expression in fetal (60, 90, 118, and 138 d of gestation, term being 145 d), newborn (7 d postnatal), and adult sheep. Total RNA was extracted, subjected to Northern blotting and hybridized using a full-length rat radiolabeled antisense RNA. Angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were detected in all fetal liver samples and appeared to increase 3-fold from 60 to 138 d gestation and then to decrease after birth. In contrast, angiotensiogen mRNA could not be detected in renal cortical tissue of 118 or 138 d fetuses, or newborn or adult sheep. We conclude that, unlike in the rat, liver angiotensinogen gene expression is detectable during the 2nd trimester of gestation in sheep and is developmentally regulated. Furthermore, in contrast to the fetal rat, angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were undetectable in fetal sheep kidney.\"\n",

      "\"Development of an empirical model to aid in designing airborne infection isolation rooms.Airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) house patients with tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and many other airborne infectious diseases. Currently, facility engineers and designers of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems have few analytical tools to estimate a room's leakage area and establish an appropriate flow differential (DeltaQ) in hospitals, shelters, and other facilities where communicable diseases are present. An accurate estimate of leakage area and selection of DeltaQ is essential for ensuring that there is negative pressure (i.e., pressure differential [DeltaP]) between an AIIR and adjoining areas. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers evaluated the relationship between DeltaQ and DeltaP in 67 AIIRs across the United States and in simulated AIIR. Data gathered in the simulated AIIR was used to develop an empirical model describing the relationship between DeltaQ, DeltaP, and leakage area. Data collected in health care facilities showed that the model accurately predicted the leakage area 44 of 48 times. Statistical analysis of the model and experimental validation showed that the model effectively estimated the actual leakage area from -39% to +22% with 90% confidence. The NIOSH model is an effective, cost-cutting tool that can be used by HVAC engineers and designers to estimate leakage area and select an appropriate DeltaQ in AIIRs to reduce the airborne transmission of disease.\"\n",

      "\"A Review of Early Experience in Lung Ultrasound in the Diagnosis and Management of COVID-19A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Since then more than eight million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported around the globe. The current gold standard for etiologic diagnosis is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of respiratory-tract specimens, but the test has a high false-negative rate owing to both nasopharyngeal swab sampling error and viral burden. Hence diagnostic imaging has emerged as a fundamental component of current management of COVID-19. Currently, high-resolution computed tomography is the main imaging tool for primary diagnosis and evaluation of disease severity in patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging has become a safe bedside imaging alternative that does not expose the patient to radiation and minimizes the risk of contamination. Although the number of studies to date is limited, LUS findings have demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, comparable with those of chest computed tomography scans. In this note we review the current state of the art of LUS in evaluating pulmonary changes induced by COVID-19. The goal is to identify characteristic sonographic findings most suited for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia infections.\"\n",

Methods During the programme, IBD specialists from around the world established by consensus two best practice charters: the 5S Principles and the 5C Concept. Results The 5S Principles were conceived to provide health care providers with key guidance for improving clinical practice based on best management approaches. They comprise the following categories: Stage the disease; Stratify patients; Set treatment goals; Select appropriate treatment; and Supervise therapy. Optimised management of patients with IBD based on the 5S Principles can be achieved most effectively within an optimised clinical care environment. Guidance on optimising the clinical care setting in IBD management is provided through the 5C Concept, which encompasses: Comprehensive IBD care; Collaboration; Communication; Clinical nurse specialists; and Care pathways. Together, the 5C Concept and 5S Principles provide structured recommendations on organising the clinical care setting and developing best-practice approaches in IBD management. Conclusions Consideration and application of these two dimensions could help health care providers optimise their IBD centres and collaborate more effectively with their multidisciplinary team colleagues and patients, to provide improved IBD care in daily clinical practice. Ultimately, this could lead to improved outcomes for patients with IBD.\"\n",

To also to determine whether the patients were managed as COVID-19 patients after their imaging findings, and the proportion who had SARS-CoV2 reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken of consecutive patients having imaging prior to urgent elective surgery (n=156) or acute abdominal imaging (n=283). Lung findings were categorised according to the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) guidelines. RT-PCR testing, management, and outcomes were determined from the electronic patient records. RESULTS: 3% (13/439) of CT examinations demonstrated findings of classic/probable COVID-19 pneumonia, whilst 4% (19/439) had findings indeterminate for COVID-19. Of the total cohort, 1.6% (7/439) subsequently had confirmed RT-PCR-positive COVID-19. Importantly, all the patients with a normal chest or alternative diagnoses on CT who had PCR testing within the next 7 days, had a negative RT-PCR (92/407). There was a change in surgical outcome in 6% (10/156) of the elective surgical cohort with no change to surgical management was demonstrated in the acute abdominal emergency cohort requiring surgery (2/283).

      "\"Cryptic properties of a cluster of dominant flavivirus cross-reactive antigenic sites.A number of flaviviruses are important human pathogens, including yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses. Infection with or immunization against any of these viruses induces a subset of antibodies that are broadly flavivirus cross-reactive but do not exhibit significant cross-neutralization. Nevertheless, these antibodies can efficiently bind to the major envelope protein (E), which is the main target of neutralizing and protective antibodies because of its receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. The structural basis for this phenomenon is still unclear. In our studies with TBE virus, we have provided evidence that such cross-reactive antibodies are specific for a cluster of epitopes that are partially occluded in the cage-like assembly of E proteins at the surfaces of infectious virions and involve-but are not restricted to-amino acids of the highly conserved internal fusion peptide loop. Virus disintegration leads to increased accessibility of these epitopes, allowing the cross-reactive antibodies to bind with strongly increased avidity. The cryptic properties of these sites in the context of infectious virions can thus provide an explanation for the observed lack of efficient neutralizing activity of broadly cross-reactive antibodies, despite their specificity for a functionally important structural element in the E protein.\"\n",

      "\"An Image Fusion System for Estimating the Therapeutic Effects of Radiofrequency Ablation on Hepatocellular Carcinoma.BACKGROUND During ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high echoic areas due to RFA-induced microbubbles can help calculate the extent of ablation. However, these areas also decrease visualization of target tumors, making it difficult to assess whether they completely cover the tumors. To estimate the effects of RFA more precisely, we used an image fusion system (IFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS We enrolled patients with a single HCC who received RFA with or without the IFS. In the IFS group, we drew a spherical marker along the contour of a target tumor on reference images immediately after administering RFA so that the synchronized spherical marker represented the contour of the target tumor on real-time ultrasound images. When the high echoic area completely covered the marker, we considered the ablation to be complete. We compared outcomes between the IFS and control groups. RESULTS We enrolled 25 patients and 20 controls, and the baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The complete ablation rates during the first RFA session were significantly higher in the IFS group compared with those in the control group (88.0% vs. 60.0%, P = 0.041). The number of RFA sessions was significantly smaller in the IFS group compared with that in the control group (1.1 ± 0.3 vs. 1.5 ± 0.7, P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS The study suggested that the IFS enables a more precise estimation of the effects of RFA on HCC, contributing to enhanced treatment efficacy and minimized patient burden.\"\n",

However, the tumor cell yields and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression between each approach have not been compared. Here, we assessed the tumor cell numbers and PD-L1 expression for Cryo with EBUS-GS for PPLs and TBB in patients with lung cancer. METHODS Sixteen patients were enrolled in this prospective study from June to November 2017 at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital. The number of tumor cells from a single biopsy, total number of tumor cells, average number of tumor cells, and 22C3 PD-L1 expression (≥ 50% and ≥ 1%) were compared between Cryo and TBB. RESULTS The numbers of tumor cells from a single biopsy, total numbers of tumor cells, and average numbers of tumor cells obtained by Cryo were significantly larger than those obtained by TBB (Cryo [means ± standard errors of the means]: 1321 ± 303.7, 1981 ± 411.7, and 1406 ± 310.3; TBB: 208.8 ± 38.24, 1044 ± 189.0, and 208.8 ± 37.81; P < 0.0001, P = 0.0474, P = 0.0006, respectively). PD-L1 ≥ 50% and ≥ 1% patients for Cryo were 18.8 and 56.3%, respectively, whereas those for TBB were 12.5 and 37.5%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, concordance, and κ coefficient based on Cryo for TBB were 66.7, 100, 100, 92.9, 93.8%, and 0.7647, respectively, for PD-L1 ≥ 50%; and 44.4, 71.4, 66.7, 50, 56.3%, and 0.1515, respectively, for PD-L1 ≥ 1%. CONCLUSION Cryo with EBUS-GS may be a useful diagnostic approach for lung cancer, with advantages over TBB for gene analysis and whole exon sequencing. Particularly, it could contribute to patients taking pembrolizumab as first-line therapy when PD-L1 was negative by evaluating TBB specimens. It could also provide ample tissue for PD-L1 expression analysis in addition to accurate diagnosis and gene analysis.\"\n",

      "\"Teleconsulta en una Unidad de Coloproctología durante la Pandemia COVID-19. Resultados preliminaresResumen Introducción: Durante el estado de alarma sanitaria establecido a causa de la pandemia de la COVID-19 se anularon la mayor parte de las consultas externas presenciales y se estableció una consulta telefónica para el seguimiento de pacientes coloproctológicos. El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar la eficacia de la consulta telefónica (teleconsulta) en el seguimiento de los pacientes de una unidad de coloproctología, en el contexto de la pandemia COVID-19. Método: Estudio descriptivo prospectivo de pacientes consecutivos en un solo centro. Se clasificó el resultado de la teleconsulta como alta, visita resuelta o reprogramación y se analizó por diferentes grupos diagnósticos. Resultados: Del 19 de marzo al 17 de abril de 2020 se realizó la teleconsulta de 190 pacientes. La tasa de respuesta fue del 94,2%(179). Las categorías diagnósticas de los pacientes atendidos fueron: 51(26,9%) neoplasia colorrectal, 48(25,3%) patología proctológica, 72(37,9%) disfunciones del suelo pélvico y 19(10%) otras patologías benignas. 105(55,26%) se pudieron recitar como si hubieran venido de forma presencial. Se dio el alta a 11(5,8%) pacientes. No se encontraron diferencias significativas entre las distintas categorías diagnósticas y la resolución de la teleconsulta. Los motivos de reprogramación se analizan en el estudio. Conclusión: En el contexto de pandemia, la teleconsulta, ha permitido resolver de forma definitiva el 61% de las visitas de seguimiento, evitando la reprogramación de 116 pacientes. El nuevo paradigma social y sanitario tras la pandemia, requerirá un replanteamiento de nuestro modelo de atención sanitaria, y en muchos aspectos la telemedicina puede ofrecer herramientas para ello. Abstract Introduction: During the state of alarm established in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the face-to-face outpatient consultations were cancelled and a telephone consultation was established to follow up coloproctological patients. The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. Results: From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. Conclusion: In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients. The new social and health paradigm after the pandemic will require a rethinking of our healthcare model, and in many aspects, telemedicine can offer tools for this.\"\n",

      "\"Recovery of duck hepatitis A virus 3 from a stable full-length infectious cDNA clone.Recently, duck hepatitis A virus 3 (DHAV-3) with genetically distinct characteristics from DHAV-1 and DHAV-2 was recognized in South Korea and China. In this short communication, we successfully constructed a stable full-length infectious cDNA clone derived from DHAV-3 by solving instability of cloned full-length cDNA in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The cDNA fragments amplified from the genome of DHAV-3 were assembled and inserted into a low-copy-number plasmid. Finally, a full-length cDNA clone containing an engineered SacII site that served as a genetic marker was obtained. The cDNA clone showed stable by serial passages in E. coli when propagated at 25°C under low level of antibiotic selection. BHK-21 cells were transfected with transcribed RNA from the full-length cDNA clone; infectious viral particles were rescued, showing its fatality to 10-day-old duck embryos. The results indicated that the constructed full-length cDNA clone of DHAV-3 is infectious. By various virological assays, our results indicated that the rescued virus exhibited similar biological properties with the parental virus. Animal experiments revealed that the rescued virus retained the high pathogenicity to 1-day-old ducklings and could induce a fatal hepatitis indistinguishable from its parental virus. Our present studies provide a useful tool for future research on genomic functions and molecular pathogenesis of DHAV-3.\"\n",

      "\"Prevalence and related factors of post-traumatic stress disorder among medical staff members exposed to H7N9 patientsOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and related factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among doctors and nurses who were exposed to H7N9 patients during the H7N9 influenza epidemic. To provide scientific basis for promoting the physical and psychological health of these staff members. METHOD: The 102 medical staff workers who were exposed to H7N9 patients were recruited through convenient sampling between January 2015 and May 2016. We used a self-reported questionnaire, the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), to evaluate the PTSD symptoms among doctors and nurses from an intensive care unit (n = 61), a respiratory department (n = 20), and an emergency department (n = 21). We then analyzed the related factors. RESULTS: Around 20.59% of the tested doctors and nurses showed PTSD symptoms. The sample had a mean PCL-C score of 30.00 ± 9.95. The differences in the scores of doctors and nurses with different genders, ages, professional titles, contact frequencies, trainings, and experiences were statistically significant (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Moreover, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance showed that nurses received higher scores than doctors, female participants received higher scores than male participants, and the participants with low professional title and high contact frequency, aged between 20 years and 30 years, with less than five years of work experience, having not received related training and with no related experience obtained higher PCL-C scores than the others (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The PTSD level of doctors and nurses after their exposure to H7N9 patients was high, which warrant further research. Health and medical institutions should pay attention to the physical and psychological health of these staff members.\"\n",

Skin and skeletal developmental malformations are common and may manifest as significant physical anomalies. However, few reports have discussed surgical treatment. A 37-year-old woman presented with disproportionate enlargement of the right buttock, which required volume reduction. The overgrown tissue was combined with vascular malformations, which in our patient were extremely thick. The patient experienced massive blood loss during the procedure, due to which a blood transfusion was performed. Pathological findings revealed partial lipohyperplasia with venous malformations.

      "\"Results and complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.PURPOSE Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has gained popularity and acceptance among bariatric surgeons, mainly due its low morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of SG on weight loss, and to determine the postoperative course, clinical presentation and treatment of complications after SG. METHODS Between January 2006 and October 2012, 153 consecutive patients underwent SG. All data were prospectively collected in a computerized database. RESULTS This series comprised 119 females and 34 males with a median age of 46 years and a median preoperative BMI of 42.3 kg/m2. The median EWL was 53.0 % after 18.4 months of follow-up. The median postoperative BMI was 33.3 kg/m2 (range 19.7–56.1 kg/m2). Eight patients (5.2 %) required re-laparoscopy to manage postoperative hemorrhage (3.3 %) and leakage (1.9 %). Neither abdominal drains nor postoperative contrast-swallow studies were successful in diagnosing hemorrhage or leaks in our patients. CONCLUSION SG is an effective procedure to achieve significant short-term weight loss. Clinical signs, such as tachycardia, pain, fever and hypotension, provide the best evidence of the presence of postoperative leakage or bleeding. An early diagnosis of these complications is the key to ensuring adequate treatment with immediate re-laparoscopy.\"\n",

      "\"The interaction between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3C-like proteinase and a dimeric inhibitor by capillary electrophoresisAbstract 3C-like proteinase of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus has been demonstrated to be a key target for drug design against SARS. The interaction between SARS coronavirus 3C-like (3CL) proteinase and an octapeptide interface inhibitor was studied by affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). The binding constants were estimated by the change of migration time of the analytes in the buffer solution containing different concentrations of SARS 3CL proteinase. The results showed that SARS 3CL proteinase was able to complex with the octapeptide competitively, with binding constants of 2.44×104 M−1 at 20°C and 2.11×104 M−1 at 37°C. In addition, the thermodynamic parameters deduced reveal that hydrophobic interaction might play major roles, along with electrostatic force, in the binding process. The ACE method used here could be developed to be an effective and simple way of applying large-scale drug screening and evaluation.\"\n",

Owing to their selectivity in attack on regions of nervous tissue, governed by viral factors and by routes of invasion, viral receptors or metabolic machineries of infected cells, certain viral infections show similarities in distribution of their resulting lesions in the nervous system to that of the common human neurodegenerative diseases (namely, motor neurons disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease).

Surgical biopsy is more difficult for these lesions because intraoperative localization has to be made without the aid of direct visualization or manual palpation. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy can be used in the operating room to identify a small peripheral lesion and marked using an injection of methylene blue, which can be seen on the visceral pleura of the lung. We present our initial experience using this technique. The sample was eight patients who had peripheral lesions with an average size of 19 mm. Surgical wedge biopsy was diagnostic in all cases, with an average procedure time of 28 minutes. There were no complications from this procedure.

Screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics, except in some island countries, and will likely be even less effective in the modern era.

A study was undertaken to investigate the sputum cell and cytokine characteristics of COPD when stable and during an exacerbation. METHODS Induced sputum samples from 57 patients with moderate to severe COPD were analysed (44 samples were taken during a stable period and 37 during an exacerbation). The patients recorded daily symptoms on diary cards. Cell counts and sputum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were measured. RESULTS Patients with >/=3 exacerbations/year had higher median stable sputum levels of IL-6 (110 (95% CI 11 to 215) pg/ml) and IL-8 (6694 (95% CI 3120 to 11995) pg/ml) than those with =2 exacerbations/year (22 (95% CI 12 to 93) and 1628 (95% CI 607 to 4812) pg/ml, respectively). Median IL-6 levels were increased during exacerbations compared with stable conditions. The levels of IL-6 during exacerbations were related to the presence of a cold and to the total cell count and eosinophil and lymphocyte numbers, while IL-8 was positively correlated with all sputum cell counts. Sputum cell counts and cytokine levels during an exacerbation did not predict the size and duration of lung function changes in the exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS Patients with more frequent exacerbations have higher baseline sputum cytokine levels, which may predict the frequency of future exacerbations.\"\n",

      "\"Inferring Restricted Regular Expressions with Interleaving from Positive and Negative SamplesThe presence of a schema for XML documents has numerous advantages. Unfortunately, many XML documents in practice are not accompanied by a schema or a valid schema. Therefore, it is essential to devise algorithms to infer schemas. The fundamental task in XML schema inference is to learn regular expressions. In this paper, we focus on learning the subclass of RE(&) called SIREs (the subclass of regular expressions with interleaving). Previous work in this direction lacks inference algorithms that support inference from positive and negative examples. We provide an algorithm to learn SIREs from positive and negative examples based on genetic algorithms and parallel techniques. Our algorithm also has better expansibility, which means that our algorithm not only supports learning with positive and negative examples, but also supports learning with positive or negative examples only. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.\"\n",

      "\"Geographical Variance in the Use of Tranexamic Acid for Major Trauma Patients.Background and Objectives: The CRASH-2 trial is the largest randomised control trial examining tranexamic acid (TXA) for injured patients. Since its publication, debate has arisen around whether results could be applied to mature trauma systems in developed nations, with global opinion divided. The aim of this study was to determine if, among trauma patients in or at significant risk of major haemorrhages, there is an association of geographic region with the proportion of patients that received tranexamic acid. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Potentially eligible papers were first screened via title and abstract screening. A full copy of the remaining papers was then obtained and screened for final inclusion. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomised control trials was used for quality assessment of the final studies included. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, reporting variation in use sub-grouped by geographical location. Results: There were 727 papers identified through database searching and 23 manuscripts met the criteria for final inclusion in this review. There was a statistically significant variation in the use of TXA for included patients. Europe and Oceania had higher usage rates of TXA compared to other continents. Use of TXA in Asia and Africa was significantly less than other continents and varied use was observed in North America. Conclusions: A large geographical variance in the use of TXA for trauma patients in or at significant risk of major haemorrhage currently exists. The populations in Asia and Africa, where the results of CRASH-2 could be most readily generalised to, reported low rates of use. The reason why remains unclear and further research is required to standardise the use of TXA for trauma resuscitation.\"\n",

      "\"Efficient annotation of non-coding RNA structures including pseudoknots via automated filters.Computational search of genomes for RNA secondary structure is an important approach to the annotation of non-coding RNAs. The bottleneck of the search is sequence-structure alignment, which is often computationally intensive. A plausible solution is to devise effective filters that can efficiently remove segments unlikely to contain the desired structure patterns in the genome and to apply search only on the remaining portions. Since filters can be substructures of the RNA to be searched, the strategy to select which substructures to use as filters is critical to the overall search speed up. Such an issue becomes more involved when the structure contains pseudoknots; approaches that can filter pseudoknots are yet available. In this paper, a new effective filtration scheme is introduced to filter RNA pseudoknots. Based upon the authors' earlier work in tree-decomposable graph model for RNA pseudoknots, the new scheme can automatically derive a set of filters with the overall optimal filtration ratio. Search experiments on both synthetic and biological genomes showed that, with this filtration approach, RNA structure search can speed up 11 to 60 folds while maintaining the same search sensitivity and specificity of without the filtration. In some cases, the filtration even improves the specificity that is already high.\"\n",

This H7N9 subtype virus has since infected 240 people and killed 60, and has awakened global concern as a potential pandemic threat. Ecological niche modeling has seen increasing applications as a useful tool in mapping geographic potential and risk of disease transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPALS: We developed two datasets based on seasonal variation in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the MODIS sensor to characterize environmental dimensions of H7N9 virus. One-third of well-documented cases was used to test robustness of models calibrated based on the remaining two-thirds, and model significance was tested using partial ROC approaches. A final niche model was calibrated using all records available. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Central-eastern China appears to represent an area of high risk for H7N9 spread, but suitable areas were distributed more spottily in the north and only along the coast in the south; highly suitable areas also were identified in western Taiwan. Areas identified as presenting high risk for H7N9 spread tend to present consistent NDVI values through the year, whereas unsuitable areas show greater seasonal variation.\"\n",

      "\"Circular stapler size and risk of anastomotic complications in gastroduodenostomy for gastric cancer.BACKGROUND A Billroth I reconstruction with a mechanically sutured anastomosis is commonly performed in gastric cancer patients. Some surgeons prefer to use large circular staplers during suturing to minimize risks for anastomotic stricture and gastric stasis after surgery. The effect of stapler size on anastomotic complications has not been validated. METHODS This study was conducted with 1,031 patients who underwent gastrectomy and Billroth I reconstruction at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, between January 2007 and October 2008. Patients were assigned to group A (384 patients) or group B (647 patients) depending on the size of the circular stapler that the surgeon selected for mechanical anastomosis. A 25 mm circular stapler was used for patients in group A, and a 28 or 29 mm circular stapler was used for patients in group B. Postoperative complications were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS The incidence of complications (e.g., gastric stasis, anastomotic stricture, and bleeding) did not differ significantly between groups. Age greater than 60 years was the only significant risk factor for anastomotic complications identified in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS Stapler size was unrelated to complications, such as stricture and gastric stasis. Age was the only significant risk factor for anastomotic complications after gastroduodenostomy.\"\n",

      "\"Trauma complications and in-hospital mortality: failure-to-rescueBACKGROUND: Reducing medical errors and minimizing complications have become the focus of quality improvement in medicine. Failure-to-rescue (FTR) is defined as death after a surgical complication, which is an institution-level surgical safety and quality metric that is an important variable affecting mortality rates in hospitals. This study aims to examine whether complication and FTR are different across low- and high-mortality hospitals for trauma care. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at trauma care hospitals registered at Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB) from 2004 to 2017. Trauma patients aged ≥ 15 years with injury severity score (ISS) of ≥ 3 and those who survived for > 48 h after hospital admission were included. The hospitals in JTDB were categorized into three groups by standardized mortality rate. We compared trauma complications, FTR, and in-hospital mortality by a standardized mortality rate (divided by the institute-level quartile). RESULTS: Among 184,214 patients that were enrolled, the rate of any complication was 12.7%. The overall mortality rate was 3.7%, and the mortality rate among trauma patients without complications was only 2.8% (non-precedented deaths). However, the mortality rate among trauma patients with any complications was 10.2% (FTR). Hospitals were categorized into high- (40 facilities with 44,773 patients), average- (72 facilities with 102,368 patients), and low- (39 facilities with 37,073 patients) mortality hospitals, using the hospital ranking of a standardized mortality rate. High-mortality hospitals showed lower ISS than low-mortality hospitals [10 (IQR, 9–18) vs. 11 (IQR, 9–20), P < 0.01]. Patients in high-mortality hospitals showed more complications (14.2% vs. 11.2%, P < 0.01), in-hospital mortality (5.1% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.01), FTR (13.6% vs. 7.4%, P < 0.01), and non-precedented deaths (3.6% vs. 1.9%, P < 0.01) than those in low-mortality hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike reports of elective surgery, complication rates and FTR are associated with in-hospital mortality rates at the center level in trauma care.\"\n",

Leaf Extract Attenuates Lung Inflammation in Mice with Acute Lung InjuryThe hydroalcoholic extract of Punica granatum (pomegranate) leaves was previously demonstrated to be anti-inflammatory in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced acute peritonitis. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from the pomegranate leaf hydroalcoholic extract (EAFPg) on the LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model. Male Swiss mice received either EAFPg at different doses or dexamethasone (per os) prior to LPS intranasal instillation. Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Animals were culled at 4 h after LPS challenge, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung samples were collected for analysis. EAFPg and kaempferol effects on NO and cytokine production by LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were also investigated. Pretreatment with EAFPg (100–300 mg/kg) markedly reduced cell accumulation (specially neutrophils) and collagen deposition in the lungs of ALI mice. The same animals presented with reduced lung and BALF TNF-α and IL-1β expression in comparison with vehicle controls (p < 0.05). Additionally, incubation with either EAFPg or kaempferol (100 μg/ml) reduced NO production and cytokine gene expression in cultured LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Overall, these results demonstrate that the prophylactic treatment with EAFPg attenuates acute lung inflammation. We suggest this fraction may be useful in treating ALI.\"\n",

      "\"Clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A single arm meta-analysisOBJECTIVE: We aim to summarize reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652). The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061). CONCLUSION: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare. The case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). This meta-analysis also has limitations, so the conclusions of this Meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.\"\n",

      "\"The first, holistic immunological model of COVID-19: Implications for prevention, diagnosis, and public health measuresThe natural history of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infection, mainly in children, to multi-organ failure, eventually fatal, mainly in the eldest. We propose here the first model explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10-15 days after infection, depends on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, mannose-binding lectin). If SARS-CoV-2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens. The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high-affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm), leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal. Low-moderate physical activity can still be recommended. However, extreme physical activity and oral breathing with hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID-19 facilitates re-inhalation and early direct penetration of high numbers of own virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway's mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies (\"viral auto-inhalation\" phenomenon). This allows the virus to bypass the efficient immune barrier of the upper airway mucosa in already infected, young, and otherwise healthy athletes. In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptive immune response reaches the lungs first is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient. This \"quantitative and time-/sequence-dependent\" model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19 at all ages.\"\n",

      "\"Outbreak of human metapneumovirus detected by use of the Vero E6 cell line in isolates collected in Yamagata, Japan, in 2004 and 2005.A number of epidemiological studies have shown human metapneumovirus (hMPV) to be one of the most important viral agents associated with acute respiratory infections in humans. However, due to the difficulty in growing the virus, all epidemiological studies of hMPV infection have been performed on the basis of the molecular method. Thus, the development of a cell line suitable for the isolation of hMPV from clinical specimens is a crucial step for further research. Using the Vero E6 cell line, which could be stably maintained for 1 month without passage or medium change, we succeeded in isolating 79 strains from 4,112 specimens obtained in Yamagata, Japan, in 2004 and 2005. The total isolation rate was 1.9% (79/4,112). The monthly distribution revealed that hMPV infections occurred between February and April in 2004 and throughout most of the year in 2005. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that subgenogroup B2 was predominant in 2004, whereas three subgenogroups, A2, B1, and B2, had cocirculated in 2005. Although multiple subgenogroups cocirculated in 2005, each individual subgenogroup strain was found to predominate at specific sites. An infectivity assay of hMPV strains also indicated that the infection efficiency in Vero E6 cells was better than that in LLC-MK2 cells. Finally, we found that Vero E6 cells are useful for the isolation of hMPVs and that this utility might aid further research into hMPVs beyond the epidemiological data shown in this study.\"\n",

      "\"The Impact of Population, Contact, and Spatial Heterogeneity on Epidemic Model Predictions.Our objective was to evaluate the effect that complexity in the form of different levels of spatial, population, and contact heterogeneity has in the predictions of a mechanistic epidemic model. A model that simulates the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases between animal populations was developed. Sixteen scenarios of foot-and-mouth disease infection in cattle were analyzed, involving combinations of the following factors: multiple production-types (PT) with heterogeneous contact and population structure versus single PT, random versus actual spatial distribution of population units, high versus low infectivity, and no vaccination versus preemptive vaccination. The epidemic size and duration was larger for scenarios with multiple PT versus single PT. Ignoring the actual unit locations did not affect the epidemic size in scenarios with multiple PT/high infectivity, but resulted in smaller epidemic sizes in scenarios using multiple PT/low infectivity. In conclusion, when modeling fast-spreading epidemics, knowing the actual locations of population units may not be as relevant as collecting information on population and contact heterogeneity. In contrast, both population and spatial heterogeneity might be important to model slower spreading epidemic diseases. Our findings can be used to inform data collection and modeling efforts to inform health policy and planning.\"\n",

This study aims to evaluate the association of the TyG index with the severity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The study included a cohort of 151 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan. Regression models were used to investigate the association between TyG with severity and mortality of COVID-19. RESULTS: In this cohort, 39 (25.8%) patients had diabetes, 62 (41.1%) patients were severe cases, while 33 (22.0%) patients died in hospital. The TyG index levels were significantly higher in the severe cases and death group (mild vs. severe 8.7 ± 0.6 vs. 9.2 ± 0.6, P < 0.001; survivor vs. deceased 8.8 ± 0.6 vs. 9.3 ± 0.7, P < 0.001), respectively. The TyG index was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe case and mortality, after controlling for potential confounders (OR for severe case, 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.3, P = 0.007; OR for mortality, 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.7, P = 0.016). The associations were not statistically significant for further adjustment of inflammatory factors. CONCLUSION: TyG index was closely associated with the severity and morbidity in COVID-19 patients, thus it may be a valuable marker for identifying poor outcome of COVID-19.\"\n",

      "\"Role of macrolide therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The Global Burden of Disease study has concluded that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020, and will increase its ranking of disability-adjusted life years lost from 12th to 5th. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are associated with impaired quality of life and pulmonary function. More frequent or severe AECOPDs have been associated with especially markedly impaired quality of life and a greater longitudinal loss of pulmonary function. COPD and AECOPDs are characterized by an augmented inflammatory response. Macrolide antibiotics are macrocyclical lactones that provide adequate coverage for the most frequently identified pathogens in AECOPD and have been generally included in published guidelines for AECOPD management. In addition, they exert broad-ranging, immunomodulatory effects both in vitro and in vivo, as well as diverse actions that suppress microbial virulence factors. Macrolide antibiotics have been used to successfully treat a number of chronic, inflammatory lung disorders including diffuse panbronchiolitis, asthma, noncystic fibrosis associated bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. Data in COPD patients have been limited and contradictory but the majority hint to a potential clinical and biological effect. Additional, prospective, controlled data are required to define any potential treatment effect, the nature of this effect, and the role of bronchiectasis, baseline colonization, and other cormorbidities.\"\n",

ADEM is clinically characterized by the acute onset of focal neurological signs and encephalopathy. Patients can require intensive care unit admission because of encephalopathy, coma, seizures or tetraplegia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis usually shows lymphocytic pleocytosis but, unlike viral or bacterial encephalitis, no evidence of direct CNS infection is found. There are no biologic markers of the disease and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging is essential to ADEM diagnosis, detecting diffuse or multifocal asymmetrical lesions throughout the white matter on T2- and FLAIR-weighted sequences. High-dose intravenous steroids are accepted as first-line ADEM therapy and several studies also reported beneficial effects of plasma exchanges and intravenous immunoglobulins.

As observed in previous seasons, pandemic A/H1N1 09 virus was detected in severe cases during the 2011–2012 winter season and finally, during the 2013–2014 winter season it became the most prevalent influenza virus. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of the whole viral genome are necessary to determine the antigenic and pathogenic characteristics of influenza viruses that cause severe outcomes of the disease. In this paper, we analyzed the evolution, antigenic and genetic drift of Mexican isolates from 2009, at the beginning of the pandemic, to 2014. We found a clear variation of the virus in Mexico from the 2011–2014 season due to different markers and in accordance with previous reports. In this study, we identified 13 novel substitutions with important biological effects, including virulence, T cell epitope presented by MHC and host specificity shift and some others substitutions might have more than one biological function. The systematic monitoring of mutations on whole genome of influenza A pH1N1 (2009) virus circulating at INER in Mexico City might provide valuable information to predict the emergence of new pathogenic influenza virus\"\n",

      "\"Sample Pretreatment and Nucleic Acid-Based Detection for Fast Diagnosis Utilizing Microfluidic SystemsRecently, micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technology and micromachining techniques have enabled miniaturization of biomedical devices and systems. Not only do these techniques facilitate the development of miniaturized instrumentation for biomedical analysis, but they also open a new era for integration of microdevices for performing accurate and sensitive diagnostic assays. A so-called “micro-total-analysis-system”, which integrates sample pretreatment, transport, reaction, and detection on a small chip in an automatic format, can be realized by combining functional microfluidic components manufactured by specific MEMS technologies. Among the promising applications using microfluidic technologies, nucleic acid-based detection has shown considerable potential recently. For instance, micro-polymerase chain reaction chips for rapid DNA amplification have attracted considerable interest. In addition, microfluidic devices for rapid sample pretreatment prior to nucleic acid-based detection have also achieved significant progress in the recent years. In this review paper, microfluidic systems for sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and detection for fast diagnosis will be reviewed. These microfluidic devices and systems have several advantages over their large-scale counterparts, including lower sample/reagent consumption, lower power consumption, compact size, faster analysis, and lower per unit cost. The development of these microfluidic devices and systems may provide a revolutionary platform technology for fast sample pretreatment and accurate, sensitive diagnosis.\"\n",

      "\"Critical combination of initial markers for predicting refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children: a case control studyBACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the responses of refractory and common Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia to macrolides differ. Hence, this study aimed to identify biomarkers that may be used to distinguish refractory and common pneumonias caused by MP in children at hospital admission. METHODS: The study included 123 children divided into five groups according to infection agent and treatment protocol: Group I included those with MP infection without documented viral infection, treated with only macrolides; Group II included those with MP infection without documented viral infection, treated with a combination of macrolides and methylprednisolone; Group III included those with MP infection and documented viral infection, treated with only macrolides; Group IV included those with viral pneumonia without documented MP infection; Group V was the control group composed of admitted children without MP or a documented viral infection. These five groups were further subdivided into Groups A (including Groups I, III, IV, and V) and B (Group II) according to the responses to macrolide treatment. Concentrations of cytokines interleukin 6, interleukin 17, interleukin 18, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin of all children were evaluated, and these levels were compared among the groups. Statistical comparisons were made using Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Serum lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 18, and ferritin concentrations were significantly higher in Group II than in Groups I, III, IV, and V and were significantly higher in Group B than in Group A. When the serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration was 350 IU/L or higher, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 73 and 80%, respectively. When the interleukin 18 level was 360 pg/mL or higher, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 93 and 70%, respectively. When the ferritin level was 230 pg/mL or higher, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 67 and 67%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 18, and ferritin constitute the critical combination of biomarkers useful for predicting refractory MP pneumonia in children at hospital admission.\"\n",

      "\"Pulmonary resections: cytostructural effects of different-wavelength lasers versus electrocautery.AIMS AND BACKGROUND There are few papers on the cytostructural effects of surgical instruments used during pulmonary resections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the parenchymal damage caused by different surgical instruments: a new generation electrosurgical scalpel and two different-wavelength lasers. METHODS Six surgical procedures of pulmonary resection for nodules were performed using a new generation electrosurgical scalpel, a 1318 nm neodymium (Nd:YAG) laser or a 2010 nm thulium laser (two procedures for each instrument). Specimens were analyzed using optical microscopy and scansion electronic microscopy. RESULTS Severe cytostructural damage was found to be present in an average of 1.25 mm in depth from the cutting surface in the patients treated using electrosurgical cautery. The depth of this zone dropped to less than 1 mm in patients treated by laser, being as small as 0.2 mm using the laser with a 2010 nm-wavelength and 0.6 mm with the 1318 nm-wavelength laser. DISCUSSION These preliminary findings support the use of laser to perform conservative pulmonary resections (i.e., metastasectomies), since it is more likely to avoid damage to surrounding structures. Controlled randomized trials are needed to support the clinical usefulness and feasibility of new types of lasers for pulmonary resections.\"\n",

      "\"A seven-helix coiled coil.Coiled-coil proteins contain a characteristic seven-residue sequence repeat whose positions are designated a to g. The interacting surface between alpha-helices in a classical coiled coil is formed by interspersing nonpolar side chains at the a and d positions with hydrophilic residues at the flanking e and g positions. To explore how the chemical nature of these core amino acids dictates the overall coiled-coil architecture, we replaced all eight e and g residues in the GCN4 leucine zipper with nonpolar alanine side chains. Surprisingly, the alanine-containing mutant forms a stable alpha-helical heptamer in aqueous solution. The 1.25-A resolution crystal structure of the heptamer reveals a parallel seven-stranded coiled coil enclosing a large tubular channel with an unusual heptad register shift between adjacent staggered helices. The overall geometry comprises two interleaved hydrophobic helical screws of interacting cross-sectional a and d layers that have not been seen before. Moreover, asparagines at the a positions play an essential role in heptamer formation by participating in a set of buried interhelix hydrogen bonds. These results demonstrate that heptad repeats containing four hydrophobic positions can direct assembly of complex, higher-order coiled-coil structures with rich diversity for close packing of alpha-helices.\"\n",

It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment. Use of high flow devices and non-invasive ventilation has been discouraged due to high chances of aerosol generation. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation areessential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases. Hydrophobic viral filter in the ventilator circuit minimizes chances of transmission of virus. Strategies to manage ARDS in COVID-19 include low tidal volume ventilation with liberal sedation-analgesia. At the same time, prevention of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers is extremely important in the intensive care setting dealing with severe cases and requiring procedures generating aerosol.

Contrasting definitional boundaries and regulatory mechanisms partition them socio-institutionally. But despite these attempts at purification, TE and XT have proven increasingly difficult to tell apart in practical and material terms. Human and animal matters, cell cultures and tissue products have much greater corporeal connection than has been institutionally recognized, and are therefore a source of acute instability in the regulation of implants and transplants.

Chemical probing experiments have been done both in the presence and absence of the initiator tRNA with dimethyl sulfate, kethoxal and carbodiimide as reagent probes. As an mRNA, a mini-mRNA containing the initiation region of bacteriophage λ gene cro has been used. This region is characterized by a long single-stranded Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence followed by two hairpin structures of which the first one comprises in its loop the initiation codon. As compared to a free mRNA, the only nucleotides additionally protected in the binary mRNA-ribosome complex have been those which belong to the S-D sequence and the initiation codon. The protection of other nucleotides has not changed. Addition of the initiator RNA results in the modification of nucleotides in the stems of the downstream hairpin structures of the initiation region. This reflects their transition into a single-stranded conformation promoted by tRNA. A possible implication of these findings for the decoding process is discussed.\"\n",

      "\"Adenoviral-expressed GP(5) of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus differs in its cellular maturation from the authentic viral protein but maintains known biological functionsThe ORFs 5, 6 and 7, encoding for the three major structural proteins, GP(5), M and N, of the IAF-Klop strain of PRRSV were cloned and expressed in 293 cells using replication-defective human type 5 adenoviral vectors (hAdVs). Although the M protein gene could be cloned into hAdVs and expressed constituvely in 293 cells under the control of the hCMV immediate early promotor/enhancer, hAdVs expressing N and GP(5) proteins, which appeared to be toxic or interfered with adenovirus replication, could only be generated by inclusion of a tetracycline-regulatable promotor in the transfer vector pAdTR5. The recombinant (rec) proteins appeared similar to the authentic viral proteins in regards to their M (r)s and antigenicities. However, the recGP(5) apparently possesses different N-linked oligosaccharides residues. Its sensitivity to endo-β-galactosidase digestion indicates that poly-N-acetyllactosamine is present on the individually-expressed protein, but not on the authentic GP(5) anchored into the virion envelope. The recGP(5) apparently accumulates within the ER compartment as a glycoprotein that possesses high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharide side chains sensitive to endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment, by contrast to its viral counterpart for which N-linked oligosaccharide side chains are of both high-mannose and complex types. Coinfection of 293 cells with hAdVs expressing the M and GP(5) did not lead to M-GP(5) heterodimer formation, as demonstrated in PRRSV-infected cells. Moreover, cells infected with inducible hAdV/ORF5 showed that GP(5) of the North American strain is proapoptotic. Indeed, when the expression cassette was turned-on, caspase 3 activity in hAdV/ORF5 infected cells was enhanced and DNA fragmentation could be detected by TUNEL assays. Pigs intradermally injected twice with hAdV/ORF5 developed antibody titers to the authentic viral GP(5) as soon as 10 days following challenge with the homologous virulent PRRSV strain, as revealed by Western blot and virus neutralization tests, suggesting the establishment of a specific immune memory.\"\n",

Assessment of gastrointestinal motility in these patients can serve to establish diagnosis and to guide therapy. Major advances in diagnostic techniques during the past 5-10 years have led to this update about indications for and selection and performance of currently available tests. As symptoms have poor concordance with gastrointestinal motor dysfunction, clinical motility testing is indicated in patients in whom there is no evidence of causative mucosal or structural diseases such as inflammatory or malignant disease. Transit tests using radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, breath tests and wireless motility capsules are noninvasive. Other tests of gastrointestinal contractility or sensation usually require intubation, typically represent second-line investigations limited to patients with severe symptoms and are performed at only specialized centres. This Consensus Statement details recommended tests as well as useful clinical alternatives for investigation of gastric, small bowel and colonic motility. The article provides recommendations on how to classify gastrointestinal motor disorders on the basis of test results and describes how test results guide treatment decisions.\"\n",

      "\"Single Center Trends in Acute Coronary Syndrome Volume and Outcomes During the COVID-19 PandemicBACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly affected healthcare delivery across the world. In this report, we aim to further characterize the changes in cardiac catheterization at our institution, specifically in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization between December 23, 2019 and April 12, 2020 at our institution. All patients with cardiac catheterizations for ACS, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) activation, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) were analyzed. Cardiac catheterization volume, as well as clinical and procedural characteristics of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, was compared before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Patients presenting with ACS and OHCA were similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities during both time periods. The mean monthly volume for ACS cases dropped by 26% during the pandemic, which was consistent among both unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and STEMI cases. OHCA volume decreased significantly as well (five cases per month before to zero cases during the pandemic, P = 0.01). Among patients with STEMI, initial markers of cardiac injury, door-to-balloon time, and all-cause mortality were similar in both time periods. CONCLUSIONS: With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in cardiac catheterization volume across the spectrum of ACS at our institution, which was consistent with reports from other centers across the globe. Patients with STEMI during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic did not seem to have delays in presentation or significant differences in all-cause mortality at our institution.\"\n",

      "\"Race/Ethnicity, Underlying Medical Conditions, Homelessness, and Hospitalization Status of Adult Patients with COVID-19 at an Urban Safety-Net Medical Center - Boston, Massachusetts, 2020.As of July 5, 2020, approximately 2.8 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 130,000 COVID-19-associated deaths had been reported in the United States (1). Populations historically affected by health disparities, including certain racial and ethnic minority populations, have been disproportionally affected by and hospitalized with COVID-19 (2-4). Data also suggest a higher prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among persons experiencing homelessness (5). Safety-net hospitals,† such as Boston Medical Center (BMC), which provide health care to persons regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay, treat higher proportions of these populations and might experience challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. This report describes the characteristics and clinical outcomes of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 treated at BMC during March 1-May 18, 2020. During this time, 2,729 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated at BMC and categorized into one of the following mutually exclusive clinical severity designations: exclusive outpatient management (1,543; 56.5%), non-intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization (900; 33.0%), ICU hospitalization without invasive mechanical ventilation (69; 2.5%), ICU hospitalization with mechanical ventilation (119; 4.4%), and death (98; 3.6%). The cohort comprised 44.6% non-Hispanic black (black) patients and 30.1% Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) patients. Persons experiencing homelessness accounted for 16.4% of patients. Most patients who died were aged ≥60 years (81.6%). Clinical severity differed by age, race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, and homelessness. A higher proportion of Hispanic patients were hospitalized (46.5%) than were black (39.5%) or non-Hispanic white (white) (34.4%) patients, a finding most pronounced among those aged <60 years. A higher proportion of non-ICU inpatients were experiencing homelessness (24.3%), compared with homeless patients who were admitted to the ICU without mechanical ventilation (15.9%), with mechanical ventilation (15.1%), or who died (15.3%). Patient characteristics associated with illness and clinical severity, such as age, race/ethnicity, homelessness, and underlying medical conditions can inform tailored strategies that might improve outcomes and mitigate strain on the health care system from COVID-19.\"\n",

      "\"Generation and Characterization of Eptesicus fuscus (Big brown bat) kidney cell lines immortalized using the Myotis polyomavirus large T-antigenAbstract It is speculated that bats are important reservoir hosts for numerous viruses, with 27 viral families reportedly detected in bats. Majority of these viruses have not been isolated and there is little information regarding their biology in bats. Establishing a well-characterized bat cell line supporting the replication of bat-borne viruses would facilitate the analysis of virus-host interactions in an in vitro model. Currently, few bat cell lines have been developed and only Tb1-Lu, derived from Tadarida brasiliensis is commercially available. Here we describe a method to establish and immortalize big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) kidney (Efk3) cells using the Myotis polyomavirus T-antigen. Subclones of this cell line expressed both epithelial and fibroblast markers to varying extents. Cell clones expressed interferon beta in response to poly(I:C) stimulation and supported the replication of four different viruses, namely, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PED-CoV), Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). To our knowledge, this is the first bat cell line from a northern latitude insectivorous bat developed using a novel technology. The cell line has the potential to be used for isolation of bat viruses and for studying virus-bat interactions in culture.\"\n",

      "\"Laparoscopic Surgical Skills programme: preliminary evaluation of Grade I Level 1 courses by trainees.INTRODUCTION New training models are needed to maintain safety and quality of surgical performance. A simulated setting using virtual reality, synthetic, and/or organic models should precede traditional supervised training in the operating room. AIM The aim of the paper is to describe the Laparoscopic Surgical Skills (LSS) programme and to provide information about preliminary evaluation of Grade I Level 1 courses, including overall quality, applicability of the course content in practice and the balance between theory and hands-on training modules, by participating trainees. MATERIAL AND METHODS During 5 accredited LSS Grade I Level 1 courses held in Eindhoven (the Netherlands), Kosice (Slovak Republic), and Lisbon (Portugal) between April 2011 and January 2012, demographic data and pre-course surgical experience in laparoscopic surgery of the participants were recorded. The final course evaluation form was completed by each participant after the course (anonymous) to evaluate course progress, course materials, assessment, staff, location and overall impression of the course on a 1-10 scale to obtain feedback information. RESULTS Forty-seven surgeons of 5 different nationalities were enrolled in an LSS Grade I Level 1 programme. Most participants were first or second year residents (n = 25), but also already established surgeons took part (n = 6). The mean age of the participants was 31.2 years (SD = 2.86), the male/female ratio was 32/15, and previous experience with laparoscopic surgery was limited. Overall impression of the course was rated with 8.7 points (SD = 0.78). The applicability of the course content in practice and the balance between theory and hands-on training were also rated very well - mean 8.8 (SD = 1.01) and 8.1 points (SD = 0.80) respectively. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic Surgical Skills Grade I Level 1 courses are evaluated as well balanced, with content applicable in clinical practice, meeting the expectations of individual participants. International interest in the programme suggests that LSS might become the future European standard in surgical education in laparoscopic surgery. Further conclusions concerning success of the programme may be drawn after the completion of clinical assessment of enrolled participants.\"\n",

      "\"Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy with a double-lumen endotracheal tube: a comparison of feasibility, gas exchange, and airway pressures.OBJECTIVE Gas exchange and airway pressures are markedly altered during percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT). A double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLET) has been developed for better airway management during PDT. The current study prospectively evaluated the in vivo feasibility, gas exchange, and airway pressures during PDT with DLET compared with a conventional endotracheal tube (ETT). METHODS According to eligibility criteria, patients were divided into a case group (those receiving PDT with DLET) and a control group (those receiving PDT with a conventional ETT). The Ciaglia single-dilator technique was used for PDT in both groups. The primary end point of this study was the feasibility of tracheostomy with DLET. The secondary end points were a comparison of gas exchange, airway pressures, minute volume, and tidal volume before, during, and after PDT performed with DLET and conventional ETT. RESULTS Ten patients meeting the inclusion criteria were assigned to each group. PDTs were performed without difficulties in nine patients in the DLET group and 10 patients in the conventional ETT group. During PDT, gas exchange, airway pressures, and minute ventilation remained more stable in the DLET group and were significantly different from those in the conventional ETT group. CONCLUSIONS PDT with DLET can be performed safely without difficulties limiting the technique. Furthermore, during PDT, the use of the DLET resulted in more stable gas exchange, airway pressures, and ventilation than PDT with a conventional ETT.

However, the disadvantage of this approach is that it artificially increases the dimensionality of the problem. Here, we show that the determinant of the Jacobian of the problem (function to optimize and constraints) is null. This extra equation transforms any equality-constrained optimization problem into a solving problem of same dimension. We also introduced the constraint matrices as the largest square submatrices of the Jacobian of the constraints. The boundaries of the constraint domain are given by the nullity of their determinants.

      "\"The transcriptomic profiling of COVID-19 compared to SARS, MERS, Ebola, and H1N1COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis that threatens our way of life. As of April 29, 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 200,000 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~7% and recovery rate of ~30%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.\"\n",

Here, we investigated differential gene regulation in ferrets upon subcutaneous administration of IFN-α2b and during SARS-CoV infection. In vivo experiments revealed that IFN-α2b causes STAT1 phosphorylation and upregulation of abundant IFN response genes (IRGs), chemokine receptors, and other genes that participate in phagocytosis and leukocyte transendothelial migration. During infection with SARS-CoV not only a variety of IRGs were upregulated, but also a significantly broader range of genes involved in cell migration and inflammation. This work allowed dissection of several molecular signatures present during SARS-CoV which are part of a robust IFN antiviral response. These signatures can be useful markers to evaluate the status of IFN responses during a viral infection and specific features of different viruses.\"\n",

      "\"Is Protocolised Weaning that Includes Early Extubation Onto Non-Invasive Ventilation More Cost Effective Than Protocolised Weaning Without Non-Invasive Ventilation? Findings from the Breathe StudyBACKGROUND: Optimising techniques to wean patients from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) remains a key goal of intensive care practice. The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as a weaning strategy (transitioning patients who are difficult to wean to early NIV) may reduce mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine the cost effectiveness of protocolised weaning, including early extubation onto NIV, compared with weaning without NIV in a UK National Health Service setting. METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation alongside a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised to either protocol-directed weaning from mechanical ventilation or ongoing IMV with daily spontaneous breathing trials. The primary efficacy outcome was time to liberation from ventilation. Bivariate regression of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) provided estimates of the incremental cost per QALY and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) overall and for subgroups [presence/absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and operative status]. Long-term cost effectiveness was determined through extrapolation of survival curves using flexible parametric modelling. RESULTS: NIV was associated with a mean INMB of £620 ($US885) (cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY) with a corresponding probability of 58% that NIV is cost effective. The probability that NIV is cost effective was higher for those with COPD (84%). NIV was cost effective over 5 years, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £4618 ($US6594 per QALY gained). CONCLUSIONS: The probability of NIV being cost effective relative to weaning without NIV ranged between 57 and 59% overall and between 82 and 87% for the COPD subgroup.

      "\"Mouse hepatitis virus infection of mice causes long-term depletion of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus-permissive macrophages and T lymphocyte alterationsIntraperitoneal injection of pathogen-free B10.A mice with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 resulted in a short subclinical infection which was terminated by a rapid antiviral immune response. The infection resulted in a rapid, but transient, about 10-fold increase in the number of macrophages and total cells in the peritoneum of the mice. This increase was preceded by a complete depletion of the peritoneum of the subpopulation of macrophages that supports a productive infection by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). The depletion of LDV-permissive macrophages was a long-term effect; at 50 days post-infection with MHV, the proportion of LDV-permissive macrophages in the peritoneum had reached only 20% of that observed in the peritoneum of uninfected mice, whereas the total number of macrophages in the peritoneum had returned to normal. Furthermore, MHV infection resulted in a long-term alteration in the proliferative response of spleen T cells to concanavalin A (ConA) and in their ability to produce interferon γ; several times higher concentrations of ConA were required to induce a maximum proliferative response in spleen T cell populations from 5-week MHV-infected B10.A mice than in spleen T cell populations from infected companion mice but the former produced 5 times more interferon γ than the T cells from unifected mice.\"\n",

      "\"Intraoperative fluorescence-based enhanced reality laparoscopic real-time imaging to assess bowel perfusion at the anastomotic site in an experimental model.BACKGROUND Fluorescence videography is a promising technique for assessing bowel perfusion. Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a novel concept, in which a dynamic perfusion cartogram, generated by computer analysis, is superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. The aim of this experimental study was to assess the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in perfusion in a small bowel resection-anastomosis model. METHODS A small bowel ischaemic segment was created laparoscopically in 13 pigs. Animals were allocated to having anastomoses performed at either low perfusion (25 per cent; n = 7) or high perfusion (75 per cent; n = 6), as determined by FLER analysis. Capillary lactate levels were measured in blood samples obtained by serosal puncturing in the ischaemic area, resection lines and vascularized areas. Pathological inflammation scoring of the anastomosis was carried out. RESULTS Lactate levels in the ischaemic area (mean(s.d.) 5·6(2·8) mmol/l) were higher than those in resection lines at 25 per cent perfusion (3·7(1·7) mmol/l; P = 0·010) and 75 per cent perfusion (2·9(1·3) mmol/l; P < 0·001), and higher than levels in vascular zones (2·5(1·0) mmol/l; P < 0·001). Lactate levels in resection lines with 75 per cent perfusion were lower than those in lines with 25 per cent perfusion (P < 0·001), and similar to those in vascular zones (P = 0·188). Levels at resection lines with 25 per cent perfusion were higher than those in vascular zones (P = 0·001). Mean(s.d.) global inflammation scores were higher in the 25 per cent perfusion group compared with the 75 per cent perfusion group for mucosa/submucosa (2·1(0·4) versus 1·2(0·4); P = 0·003) and serosa (1·8(0·4) versus 0·8(0·8); P = 0·014). A ratio of preanastomotic lactate levels in the ischaemic area relative to the resection lines of 2 or less was predictive of a more severe inflammation score. CONCLUSION In an experimental model, FLER appeared accurate in discriminating bowel perfusion levels. Surgical relevance Clinical assessment has limited accuracy in evaluating bowel perfusion before anastomosis. Fluorescence videography estimates intestinal perfusion based on the fluorescence intensity of injected fluorophores, which is proportional to bowel vascularization. However, evaluation of fluorescence intensity remains a static and subjective measure. Fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER) is a dynamic fluorescence videography technique integrating near-infrared endoscopy and specific software. The software generates a virtual perfusion cartogram based on time to peak fluorescence, which can be superimposed on to real-time laparoscopic images. This experimental study demonstrates the accuracy of FLER in detecting differences in bowel perfusion in a survival model of laparoscopic small bowel resection-anastomosis, based on biochemical and histopathological data. It is concluded that real-time imaging of bowel perfusion is easy to use and accurate, and should be translated into clinical use.\"\n",

      "\"Design and methods of a social network isolation study for reducing respiratory infection transmission: The eX-FLU cluster randomized trialAbstract Background Social networks are increasingly recognized as important points of intervention, yet relatively few intervention studies of respiratory infection transmission have utilized a network design. Here we describe the design, methods, and social network structure of a randomized intervention for isolating respiratory infection cases in a university setting over a 10-week period. Methodology/principal findings 590 students in six residence halls enrolled in the eX-FLU study during a chain-referral recruitment process from September 2012–January 2013. Of these, 262 joined as “seed” participants, who nominated their social contacts to join the study, of which 328 “nominees” enrolled. Participants were cluster-randomized by 117 residence halls. Participants were asked to respond to weekly surveys on health behaviors, social interactions, and influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms. Participants were randomized to either a 3-Day dorm room isolation intervention or a control group (no isolation) upon illness onset. ILI cases reported on their isolation behavior during illness and provided throat and nasal swab specimens at onset, day-three, and day-six of illness. A subsample of individuals (N =103) participated in a sub-study using a novel smartphone application, iEpi, which collected sensor and contextually-dependent survey data on social interactions. Within the social network, participants were significantly positively assortative by intervention group, enrollment type, residence hall, iEpi participation, age, gender, race, and alcohol use (all P <0.002). Conclusions/significance We identified a feasible study design for testing the impact of isolation from social networks in a university setting. These data provide an unparalleled opportunity to address questions about isolation and infection transmission, as well as insights into social networks and behaviors among college-aged students. Several important lessons were learned over the course of this project, including feasible isolation durations, the need for extensive organizational efforts, as well as the need for specialized programmers and server space for managing survey and smartphone data.\"\n",

      "\"SARS-coronavirus spike S2 domain flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833 is important for activation of membrane fusionAbstract The S2 domain of the coronavirus spike (S) protein is known to be responsible for mediating membrane fusion. In addition to a well-recognized cleavage site at the S1–S2 boundary, a second proteolytic cleavage site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S2 domain (R797). C-terminal to this S2 cleavage site is a conserved region flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833. Here, we investigated the importance of this well conserved region for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion activation. We show that the residues between C822–C833 are well conserved across all coronaviruses. Mutagenic analysis of SARS-CoV S, combined with cell–cell fusion and pseudotyped virion infectivity assays, showed a critical role for the core-conserved residues C822, D830, L831, and C833. Based on available predictive models, we propose that the conserved domain flanked by cysteines 822 and 833 forms a loop structure that interacts with components of the SARS-CoV S trimer to control the activation of membrane fusion.\"\n",

Little is known about features, outcomes and intrauterine transmission potential in newborn babies aged 28 days or less. Through systematical searching, we identified 4 infections in newborn babies in China as of March 13. The age range was 30 h to 17 days old. Three were male. Two newborn babies had fever, 1 had shortness of breath, 1 had cough and 1 had no syndromes. Supportive treatment was provided for all 4 newborn babies. None required intensive unit care or mechanical ventilation. None had any severe complications. Three newborn babies recovered by the end of this study and had been discharged with 16, 23, and 30 days of hospital stay. All 4 mothers were infected by SARS-CoV-2, 3 showing symptoms before and 1 after delivery. Cesarean section was used for all 4 mothers, 3 at level III hospitals and 1 at a level II hospital. Three newborn babies were separated from mothers right after being born and were not breastfed. In summary, newborn babies are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      "\"Selection of helical braided flow diverter stents based on hemodynamic performance and mechanical properties.BACKGROUND Although flow diversion is a promising procedure for the treatment of aneurysms, complications have been reported and it remains poorly understood. The occurrence of adverse outcomes is known to depend on both the mechanical properties and flow reduction effects of the flow diverter stent. OBJECTIVE To clarify the possibility of designing a flow diverter stent considering both hemodynamic performance and mechanical properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted based on an ideal aneurysm model with flow diverters. Structural analyses of two flow diverter models exhibiting similar flow reduction effects were performed, and the radial stiffness and longitudinal flexibility were compared. RESULTS In CFD simulations, two stents-Pore2-d35 (26.77° weave angle when fully expanded, 35 μm wire thickness) and Pore3-d50 (36.65°, 50 μm respectively)-demonstrated similar flow reduction rates (68.5% spatial-averaged velocity reduction rate, 85.0% area-averaged wall shear stress reduction rate for Pore2-d35, and 68.6%, 85.4%, respectively, for Pore3-d50). However, Pore3-d50 exhibited greater radial stiffness than Pore2-d35 (40.0 vs 21.0 mN/m at a 3.5 mm outer diameter) and less longitudinal flexibility (0.903 vs 0.104 N·mm bending moments at 90°). These measurements indicate that changing the wire thickness and weave angle allows adjustment of the mechanical properties while maintaining the same degree of flow reduction effects. CONCLUSIONS The combination of CFD and structural analysis can provide promising solutions for an optimized stent. Stents exhibiting different mechanical properties but the same flow reduction effects could be designed by varying both the weave angle and wire thickness.\"\n",

To date, no integrated analysis of patient-derived and external factors has been reported. To identify factors associated with COPD exacerbation, we collected data, including smoking status, lung function, and COPD assessment test scores, from 594 COPD patients in the Korean COPD subgroup study (KOCOSS), and merged these data with patients’ Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service data for 2007–2012. We also collected primary weather variables, including levels of particulate matter <10 microns in diameter, daily minimum ambient temperature, as well as respiratory virus activities, and the logs of web queries on COPD-related issues. We then assessed the associations between these patient-derived and external factors and COPD exacerbations. Univariate analysis showed that patient factors, air pollution, various types of viruses, temperature, and the number of COPD-related web queries were associated with COPD exacerbation. Multivariate analysis revealed that the number of exacerbations in the preceding year, female sex, COPD grade, and influenza virus detection rate, and lowest temperature showed significant association with exacerbation. Our findings may help COPD patients predict when exacerbations are likely, and provide intervention as early as possible.\"\n",

METHODS Twenty-six male Landrace White swine (mean body weight ± standard deviation, 33.8 ± 2.9 kg) were used. Ethics approval was obtained. Landrace swine underwent splenectomy (n = 13) or sham-splenectomy (n = 13), were bled to mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 40 mm Hg, which was held for 60 min, given 125 mL IV RescueFlow, held for a further 60 min, given whole blood, and held for a final 60 min. Tissue oxygen saturation, thromboelastography, oncotic pressure, urine volume and specific gravity, complete blood count, serum chemistry, body temperature, hematocrit, total solids, arterial and mixed venous blood gas, bispectral index, SAP, MAP, DAP, cardiac index, total blood volume (TBV) removed and returned, rate of hemorrhage and transfusion, spleen weight, heart rate (HR), arterial pH, lactate, PaO2, PaCO2, respiratory rate, cranial mesenteric and renal artery blood flow were recorded. Groups were compared using two-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni (P < 0.05) for repeated measures or t test for non-repeated measures. RESULTS Compared with the SSP swine, SP swine had higher HR post-splenectomy for the duration of the experiment (P < 0.03), and higher hematocrits at 15 and 60 min post splenectomy (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively). SSP swine had greater TBV removed during hemorrhage (P < 0.01); however, when blood loss based on splenic weight was considered, TBV removed was similar between groups. CONCLUSION Splenectomy likely accounts for the transient increase in hematocrit and the higher HR in SP swine prior to hemorrhage, and the differences in TBV removed between the two groups during hemorrhage. With a fixed end point model using a moderate rate of acute hemorrhage and an MAP of 40 mm Hg, splenectomy is not necessary and may confound results.\"\n",

      "\"SARS-CoV-2 and Stroke in a New York Healthcare SystemBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the current worldwide pandemic, there is mounting evidence that patients affected by the illness may develop clinically significant coagulopathy with thromboembolic complications including ischemic stroke. However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls). RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, P=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, P<0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased. Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.\"\n",

      "\"A Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome extranet: supporting local communication and information disseminationBACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to explore the use and perceptions of a local Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Extranet and its potential to support future information and communication applications. The SARS Extranet was a single, managed electronic and limited access system to manage local, provincial and other SARS control information. METHODS: During July, 2003, a web-based and paper-based survey was conducted with 53 SARS Steering Committee members in Hamilton. It assessed the use and perceptions of the Extranet that had been built to support the committee during the SARS outbreak. Before distribution, the survey was user-tested based on a think-aloud protocol, and revisions were made. Quantitative and qualitative questions were asked related to frequency of use of the Extranet, perceived overall usefulness of the resource, rationale for use, potential barriers, strengths and limitations, and potential future uses of the Extranet. RESULTS: The response rate was 69.4% (n = 34). Of all respondents, 30 (88.2%) reported that they had visited the site, and rated it highly overall (mean = 4.0; 1 = low to 5 = high). However, the site was rated 3.4 compared with other communications strategies used during the outbreak. Almost half of all respondents (44.1%) visited the site at least once every few days. The two most common reasons the 30 respondents visited the Extranet were to access SARS Steering Committee minutes (63.3%) and to access Hamilton medical advisories (53.3%). The most commonly cited potential future uses for the Extranet were the sending of private emails to public health experts (63.3%), and surveillance (63.3%). No one encountered personal barriers in his or her use of the site, but several mentioned that time and duplication of email information were challenges. CONCLUSION: Despite higher rankings of various communication strategies during the SARS outbreak, such as email, meetings, teleconferences, and other web sites, users generally perceived a local Extranet as a useful support for the dissemination of local information during public health emergencies.\"\n",

      "\"Identification of a Specific Interaction between the Coronavirus Mouse Hepatitis Virus A59 Nucleocapsid Protein and Packaging SignalAbstract The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an enveloped positive stranded RNA virus. In infected cells MHV produces a 3′ coterminal nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs. Only the genomic RNA, however, is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein and incorporated in infectious MHV virions. It is believed that an RNA packaging signal (Ps), present only in the genomic RNA, is responsible for this selectivity. Earlier studies mapped this signal to a 69-nt stem–loop structure positioned in the 3′ end of ORF1b. The selective encapsidation mechanism probably initiates by specific interaction of the packaging signal with the nucleocapsid protein. In this study we demonstrate thein vitrointeraction of the MHV-A59 nucleocapsid protein with the packaging signal of MHV using gel retardation and UV cross-linking assays. This interaction was observed not only with the nucleocapsid protein from infected cells but also with that from purified virions and from cells expressing a recombinant nucleocapsid protein. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by competition experiments with nonlabeled Ps containing RNAs, tRNA, and total cytoplasmic RNA. The results indicated that no virus specific modification of the N-protein or the presence of other viral proteins are required for thisin vitrointeraction. The assays described in this report provide us with a powerful tool for studying encapsidation (initiation) in more detail.\"\n",

      "\"Retroprosthetic seroma after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair: incidence, risk factors and clinical significance.BACKGROUND The seroma generated between the abdominal viscera and the prosthesis (retroprosthetic seroma), after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) with the implant of an intraperitoneal mesh is an unknown entity with few references in the literature. Our objective is to analyze its incidence, clinical repercussions and course of retroprosthetic seroma during the first 3 months post-operation and the factors related to its appearance, such as the relationship to preprosthetic seroma, the size of the prosthesis and the patient BMI. MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospective, descriptive study in patients undergoing LVHR using the double crown technique. After surgery, the patients had follow-ups on the seventh day and the first and third months post-operation with clinical examination and abdominal CT scan. The study endpoints were: incidence and volume of retroprosthetic seroma, clinical repercussions, relationship to body mass index (BMI), prosthesis size and the existence of preprosthetic seroma. RESULTS Fifty patients underwent LVHR using the double crown technique and were included in the study. The incidence of retroprosthetic seroma during the 3-month follow-up was 46%, there being a progressive process of spontaneous reabsorption. In just one patient (2%) there were clinical repercussions as a result of the seroma. No statistically significant relationship was found with BMI and preprosthetic seroma. A statistical relationship was found between the size of the prosthesis and the risk of suffering retroprosthetic seroma in the third month post-operation (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS Retroprosthetic seroma is an entity produced in 46% of patients undergoing LVHR with few clinical repercussions (2%). In most cases it develops in the first week post-operation and then undergoes a reabsorption process that is usually complete by the third month post-operation. The size of the prosthesis delays the reabsorption process.\"\n",

      "\"Opportunistic bacterial, viral and fungal infections of the lungAbstract Opportunistic infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in severely immunocompromised patients, such as those receiving chemotherapy or biological therapies, patients with haematological malignancy, aplastic anaemia or HIV infection, and recipients of solid-organ or stem cell transplants. The type and degree of the immune defect dictate the profile of potential opportunistic pathogens; T-cell-mediated defects increase the risk of viral (cytomegalovirus, respiratory viruses) and Pneumocystis jirovecii infections, whereas neutrophil defects are associated with bacterial pneumonia and invasive aspergillosis. However, patients often have combinations of immune defects, and a wide range of other opportunistic infections can cause pneumonia. Importantly, conventional non-opportunistic pathogens are frequently encountered in immunocompromised hosts and should not be overlooked. The radiological pattern of disease (best assessed by computed tomography) and speed of onset help to identify the likely pathogen(s); radiological imaging can subsequently be supported by targeted investigation including the early use of bronchoscopy in selected patients. Rapid and expert clinical assessment can identify the most likely pathogens, which can then be treated aggressively, providing the best opportunity for a positive clinical outcome.\"\n",

MATERIAL AND METHODS Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, PROSPERO, EMBASE, Scielo and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for studies published before June 2018. Keywords included \"preterm birth\", \"prophylactic cerclage\", \"history-indicated cerclage\", \"pregnancy\" and \"17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate\". Studies comparing history-indicated cerclage alone with cerclage+17-OHPC were included. The primary outcome measure was preterm birth at <24 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcome measures include preterm birth at <28 weeks, <32 weeks and <37 weeks of gestation, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, fetal birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit stay, mean gestational age at delivery, fetal/neonatal death, neurological morbidity (intraventricular hemorrhage plus periventricular leukomalacia), neonatal sepsis and a composite of severe neonatal morbidity. Severe neonatal morbidity was defined as a composite measure of periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III and IV), necrotizing enterocolitis or respiratory distress syndrome. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. Risk of bias and quality assessment were performed using the ROBINS-I and GRADE tools, respectively. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42018094559. RESULTS Five studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Of the 546 women, 357 (75%) received history-indicated cerclage alone and 189 (35%) received adjuvant 17-OHPC. The composite endpoint, severe neonatal morbidity, was present in 84 of 1515 neonates. Though there was a trend toward a reduced risk of preterm birth, the summary estimate of effect was not statistically significant when comparing cerclage alone with cerclage+17-OHPC at <24 weeks (relative risk [RR] .86, 95% confidence interval [CI] .45-1.65). Similarly, we found no differences in preterm birth at <37 weeks (RR .90, 95% CI .70-1.17) and <28 weeks (RR .85, 95% CI .54-1.32) when comparing cerclage alone with cerclage+17-OHPC. There were no differences in fetal birthweight, respiratory distress syndrome or necrotizing enterocolitis comparing cerclage alone with cerclage+17-OHPC. CONCLUSIONS Intramuscular 17-OHPC in combination with prophylactic cerclage in women with prior preterm birth had no synergistic effect in reducing spontaneous recurrent preterm birth or improving perinatal outcomes.\"\n",

      "\"A Pilot Comparative Study of Dental Students' Ability to Detect Enamel-only Proximal Caries in Bitewing Radiographs With and Without the use of AssistDent (R) Deep Learning SoftwareEnamel-only proximal caries, if detected, can be reversed by non-invasive treatments. Dental bitewing radiograph analysis is central to diagnosis and treatment planning and when used to detect enamel-only proximal caries it is an important tool in minimum intervention and preventive dentistry. However, the subtle patterns of enamel-only proximal caries visible in a bitewing radiographs are difficult to detect and often missed by dental practitioners. This pilot study measures the ability of a cohort of third-year dental students to detect enamel-only proximal caries in bitewing radiographs with and without the use of a deep learning assistive software AssistDent(R). We demonstrate an increased ability in the detection of enamel-only proximal caries by the students using AssistDent, showing a mean sensitivity level of 0.80 (95%CI {+/-} 0.04), increased from 0.50 (95%CI {+/-} 0.13) p<0.01 shown by students not using AssistDent. This improvement in ability was achieved without an increase in false positives. Mean false positives per bitewing radiograph recorded by students when using AssistDent was 2.64 (95%CI {+/-} 0.57), and by students without using AssistDent was 2.46 (95%CI {+/-} 1.51). Based on these results we conclude that the AI-based software AssistDent significantly improves third-year dental students' ability to detect enamel-only proximal caries and could be considered as a tool to support minimum intervention and preventive dentistry in teaching hospitals and general practice. We also discuss how the experience of conducting this pilot study can be used to inform the design and methodology of a follow-on study of AssistDent in dental practice use.\"\n",

      "\"Preferential production of IgM-secreting hybridomas by immunization with DNA vaccines coding for Ebola virus glycoprotein: use of protein boosting for IgG-secreting hybridoma productionPURPOSE: The goal of this study was to investigate the utility of DNA vaccines encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) as a vaccine type for the production of GP-specific hybridomas and antibodies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA vaccines were constructed to express Ebola virus GP. Mice were injected with GP DNA vaccines and their splenocytes were used for hybridoma production. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), limiting dilution subcloning, antibody purification methods, and Western blot assays were used to select GP-specific hybridomas and purify monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from the hybridoma cells. RESULTS: Twelve hybridomas, the cell supernatants of which displayed GP-binding activity, were selected by ELISA. When purified MAbs from 12 hybridomas were tested for their reactivity to GP, 11 MAbs, except for 1 MAb (from the A6-9 hybridoma) displaying an IgG2a type, were identified as IgM isotypes. Those 11 MAbs failed to recognize GP. However, the MAb from A6-9 recognized the mucin-like region of GP and remained reactive to the antigen at the lowest tested concentration (1.95 ng/mL). This result suggests that IgM-secreting hybridomas are predominantly generated by DNA vaccination. However, boosting with GP resulted in greater production of IgG-secreting hybridomas than GP DNA vaccination alone. CONCLUSION: DNA vaccination may preferentially generate IgM-secreting hybridomas, but boosting with the protein antigen can reverse this propensity. Thus, this protein boosting approach may have implications for the production of IgG-specific hybridomas in the context of the DNA vaccination platform. In addition, the purified monoclonal IgG antibodies may be useful as therapeutic antibodies for controlling Ebola virus infection.\"\n",

Decentralization of testing can put tremendous stresses on fragile health systems if the laboratory is not involved in the planning, introduction, and scale-up strategies. RECENT FINDINGS The impact of investments in novel technologies can only be realized if these tests are evaluated, adopted, and scaled up within the healthcare system with appropriate planning and understanding of the local contexts in which these technologies will be used. SUMMARY In this digital age, the laboratory needs to take on the role of the Command Centre for technology introduction and implementation. Implementation science is needed to understand the political, cultural, economic, and behavioural context for technology introduction. The new paradigm should include: building a comprehensive system of laboratories and point-of-care testing sites to provide quality-assured diagnostic services with good laboratory-clinic interface to build trust in test results and linkage to care; building and coordinating a comprehensive national surveillance and communication system for disease control and global health emergencies; conducting research to monitor the impact of new tools and interventions on improving patient care.\"\n",

Oligonucleotide patterns from the viruses were compared, and unique and overlapping oligonucleotides were identified. A comparison of the fingerprints indicated that the genome of each virus was distinguishable by the T1 RNase oligonucleotide fingerprinting technique. The greatest similarity observed was between oligonucleotides from BVD-ILC and BVD-ILN. Eighteen large oligonucleotides were conserved in all 5 BVDV isolates studied.

      "\"Outcome Risk Factors during Respiratory Infections in a Paediatric Ward in Antananarivo, Madagascar 2010–2012BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of infectious disease-related morbidity, hospitalisation and mortality among children worldwide, and particularly in developing countries. In these low-income countries, most patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), whether it is mild or severe, are still treated empirically. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with the evolution and outcome of respiratory illnesses in patients aged under 5 years old. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in a paediatric ward in Antananarivo from November 2010 to July 2012 including patients under 5 years old suffering from respiratory infections. We collected demographic, socio-economic, clinical and epidemiological data, and samples for laboratory analysis. Deaths, rapid progression to respiratory distress during hospitalisation, and hospitalisation for more than 10 days were considered as severe outcomes. We used multivariate analysis to study the effects of co-infections. RESULTS: From November 2010 to July 2012, a total of 290 patients were enrolled. Co-infection was found in 192 patients (70%). Co-infections were more frequent in children under 36 months, with a significant difference for the 19–24 month-old group (OR: 8.0). Sixty-nine percent (230/290) of the patients recovered fully and without any severe outcome during hospitalisation; the outcome was scored as severe for 60 children and nine patients (3%) died. Risk factors significantly associated with worsening evolution during hospitalisation (severe outcome) were admission at age under 6 months (OR = 5.3), comorbidity (OR = 4.6) and low household income (OR = 4.1). CONCLUSION: Co-mordidity, low-income and age under 6 months increase the risk of severe outcome for children infected by numerous respiratory pathogens. These results highlight the need for implementation of targeted public health policy to reduce the contribution of respiratory diseases to childhood morbidity and mortality in low income countries.\"\n",

OM is a multifactorial disease with multiple risk factors, including preceding or concurrent viral URT infection. Hence, OM is also a polymicrobial disease. The mechanisms by which viruses predispose to bacterial OM are replete; however, all are predicated on the general principle of compromise of primary host airway defenses. Thus, despite an as-yet incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial superinfection of a virus-compromised respiratory tract, the URT viruses are known to induce histopathology of airway mucosal epithelium, up-regulate expression of eukaryotic receptors used for bacterial adherence, alter the biochemical and rheological properties of airway mucus, and affect innate and acquired host immune functions, among others. Although discussed here in the context of OM, during preceding or concurrent viral infection of the human respiratory tract, viral impairment of airway defenses and the resulting predisposition to subsequent bacterial coinfection are also known to be operational in the mid and lower airway as well.\"\n",

Objectives: Aim of this research is to focus on the bibliometric aspects in order to measure what is published in the first 30-days of a global epidemic outbreak Methods: We searched PubMed database in order to find all relevant studies in the first 30-days from the first publication. Results: From the initial 442 identified articles, 234 were read in-extenso. The majority of papers come from China, UK and USA. 63.7% of the papers were commentaries, editorials and reported data and only 17.5% of the sources used data directly collected on the field. Topics mainly addressed were epidemiology, preparedness and generic discussion. NNR showed a reduction for both the objectives assessed from January to February. Conclusions: Diagnosis and effective preventive and therapeutic measures were the fields in which more research is still needed. The vast majority of scientific literature in the first 30-days of an epidemic outbreak is based on reported data rather than primary data.

      "\"A DNA Vaccine Encoding the VAA Gene of Vibrio anguillarum Induces a Protective Immune Response in FlounderVibrio anguillarum is a pathogenic bacterium that infects flounder resulting in significant losses in the aquaculture industry. The VAA protein previously identified in flounder is associated with a role in immune protection within these fish. In the present study, a recombinant DNA plasmid encoding the VAA gene of V. anguillarum was constructed and its potential as a DNA vaccine, to prevent the infection of V. anguillarum in flounder fish, investigated. We verified the expression of the VAA protein both in vitro in cell lines and in vivo in flounder fish. The protective effects of pcDNA3.1-VAA (pVAA) were analyzed by determination of the percentage of sIgM(+), CD4-1(+), CD4-2(+), CD8β(+) lymphocytes, and the production of VAA-specific antibodies in flounder following their immunization with the DNA vaccine. Histopathological changes in immune related tissues, bacterial load, and relative percentage survival rates of flounder post-challenge with V. anguillarum, were all investigated to assess the efficacy of the pVAA DNA vaccine candidate. Fish intramuscularly immunized with pVAA showed a significant increase in CD4-1(+), CD4-2(+), and CD8β(+) T lymphocytes at days 9, 11, and 14 post-vaccination, reaching peak T-cell levels at days 11 or 14 post-immunization. The percentage of sIgM(+) lymphocytes reached peak levels at weeks 4–5 post-immunization. Specific anti-V. anguillarum or anti-rVAA antibodies were induced in inoculated fish at days 28–35 post-immunization. The liver of vaccinated flounder exhibited only slight histopathological changes compared with a significant pathology observed in control immunized fish. Additionally, a lower bacterial burden in the liver, spleen, and kidney were observed in pVAA protected fish in response to bacterial challenge, compared with pcDNA3.1 vector control injected fish. Moreover, the pVAA vaccine confers a relative percentage survival of 50.00% following V. anguillarum infection. In summary, this is the first study indicating an initial induction of the T lymphocyte response, followed by B lymphocyte induction of specific antibodies as a result of DNA immunization of flounder. This signifies the important potential of pVAA as a DNA vaccine candidate for the control of V. anguillarum infection.\"\n",

Various scaffold material, design, including their combination with several growth- induced substances and cells application have been being investigated and used in the area of nerve tissue engineering. However, the development remains challenges today because they are still far from ideal concerning their stability, reproducibility, including complicated handling related to the poor mechanical strength. In view of the current basis, in this study the introduction of carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) as promising candidate to increase mechanical properties of nerve scaffold is reported. The incorporation of CHA was not only expected to provide better mechanical properties of the scaffold. Under physiological condition, CHA is known to be the most stable phases of calcium phosphate compound. Therefore, CHA was expected to provide controlled release calcium for better axonal environment and promote fasten nerve regeneration. This study shows that CHA incorporated gelatin membrane has ideal microstructure to prevent fibrous tissue ingrowth into the injury site, while retaining its capability to survive nerve tissue by allowing adequate glucose and specific proteins diffusion. The provided Ca2+ release to the environment promoted neuronal growth, without suppressing acetylcholine esterase release activity. Neurite elongation was dramatically higher in the gelatin membrane incorporated with CHA. Introduction of CHA into gelatin membrane represents a new generation medical device for nerve reconstruction, with CHA was considered as a promising factor.\"\n",

Methods: We developed recurrent neural network (RNN) for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics and Counterfactual-RNN (CRNN) for evaluating and exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide. We applied the developed methods to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the world. The data were collected from January 22 to April 18, 2020 by John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/MAP.HTML). Results: The average errors of 1-step to 10-step forecasting were 2.9%. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we evaluated the potential effects of a number of public health measures. We found that the estimated peak number of new cases and cumulative cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases worldwide with one week later additional intervention were reduced to 103,872, 2,104,800, and 2,271,648, respectively. The estimated total peak number of new cases and cumulative cases would be the same as the above and the maximum number of cumulative cases would be 3,864,872 in the world with 3 week later additional intervention. Duration time of the Covid-19 spread would be increased from 91 days to 123 days. Our estimation results showed that we were in the eve of stopping the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. However, we observed that transmission would quickly rebound if interventions were relaxed. Conclusions: The accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was high. The AI and causal inference-inspired methods are a powerful tool for helping public health planning and policymaking. We concluded that the spread of COVID-19 would be stopped very soon.\"\n",

Based on the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, the D(2)EA model innovatively introduces a set of quarantine states and applies both ordinary differential equations and delay differential equations to describe the transition between two states. Potential variations of practical factors are further considered to reveal the true epidemic picture. In the experiment part, we use the D(2)EA model to simulate the epidemic in Hubei Province. Fitting to the collected real data as non-linear optimization, the D(2)EA model forecasts that the accumulated confirmed infected cases in Hubei Province will reach the peak at the end of February and then steady down.

Amostras de sangue venoso foram obtidas de 16 equinos da raça Quarto de Milha, divididos em dois grupos: grupo de treinamento regular (GTR) e grupo de treinamento esporádico (GTE), em sete diferentes momentos: 30 minutos antes do exercício (M0), imediatamente após (M1), 30 minutos (M2), uma (M3), duas (M4), seis (M5) e 24 (M6) horas após o exercício. Para a análise estatística, os dados foram testados quanto à normalidade e homogeneidade de variâncias. Para comparar os grupos e os momentos em cada grupo foram utilizados testes paramétricos (ANOVA) para a análise das atividades séricas das enzimas musculares e não paramétricos (Mann-Whitney e Friedmann) para a análise do lactato sanguíneo (P<0,05). Não houve diferença significativa entre os grupos para nenhuma variável. No entanto, dentro dos grupos experimentais foi possível observar diferenças significativas entre os momentos avaliados, em relação ao lactato e à LDH. No GTE, foram observadas diferenças significativas quanto ao lactato, entre o M0 e o M1, com valores respectivos de 0,90 mmol/L (mín. 0,8 - máx. 1,6) e 3,65mmo/L (mín. 1,0 - máx. 5,7) e quanto à LDH, onde os valores descritos no M6 diferiram significativamente de M0, M1, M2, M3 e M4. No GTR, diferenças significativas entre os momentos experimentais foram observadas em relação à LDH, sendo que os valores observados no M6 foram os menores e diferiram significativamente daqueles encontrados no M1, M2, M3 e M4. Em conclusão, não houve diferença entre o condicionamento físico dos animais treinados regularmente e aqueles treinados esporadicamente. A baixa magnitude das elevações das concentrações de CK, AST e LDH após o exercício e o rápido retorno aos valores basais, inclusive do lactato, observados em ambos os grupos, sugere que todos os animais avaliados estavam condicionados e aptos a realizar tal atividade física.(AU)\"\n",

      "\"Survey of Respiratory Virus in Patients Hospitalised for Acute Exacerbations of Heart Failure - A Prospective Observational Study.INTRODUCTION Respiratory virus (RV) infections have been implicated in acute exacerbation cardiopulmunary conditions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of RV infections in patients admitted to the cardiology unit with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in a tertiary hospitals in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a single-centre, prospective observational study. A total of 194 adults (aged >21) admitted to the Singapore General Hospital with ADHF were recruited. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human coronavirus (HcoV), adenoviurs, human bocavirus (HboV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RESULTS Twenty-five (13%) had RVs detected by RV multiplex PCR. There comprised 9 rhinoviruses (36%), 4 influenza A viruses (16%), 3 HPIV (12%), 3 HCoV (12%), 2 adenoviruses (8%), 1 human HBoV (4%), 1 hMPV (4%), and 1 RSV (4%). Symptoms-wise, cough was significantly more common in the PCR-positive group (48% vs 24%, P = 0.02). There were no statistically significant differences in laboratory investigations (haemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-muscle/brain, troponin T), and radiology findings between RV PCR-positive and -negative groups. The PCR-positive group did not have increased mortality or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION This study identified a considerable burden of RVs in our ADHF cohort, and highlights the need for prevention of RVs in this group of patients. We also recognised the difficulty with clinical diagnosis of RVs in ADHF patients.\"\n",

The aim of this study was to answer the question, whether this activity originates from APN-gene expression. The total cellular activities (Ala-pNA hydrolysis) of lymphoid cell lines are up to 15 times higher than that of normal lymphocytes. Despite weak or lacking CD13 surface expression all lymphoid cell lines tested contain APNmRNA as quantified by competitive RT-PCR as well as low enzymatic activity in their particulate fractions. By isoelectric focusing two enzyme species with isoelectric points of 5.4 or between 3.5 to 4.8, respectively, were detected. To investigate whether these activities result from APN-gene we established transfectants lacking cellular APN expression of the CD13-positive histiocytic cell line U937 and the CD13-negative T cell line H9. Studies on these transfectants proved (I) that the main neutral aminopeptidase activity expressed in lymphoid cells is definitively not related to APN and (II) that APN is also expressed in lymphoid cells, although on a low level only.\"\n",

Methods From January 2014 to December 2017, 22 patients who underwent robotic procedure were classified as Group 1, and 34 patients who underwent the same laparoscopic procedure as Group 2. In addition, from September 2009 to July 2011, 13 patients who underwent laparoscopic procedure were classified as Group 3. The perioperative outcomes and short-term postoperative morbidity levels were evaluated in three groups. Results In all groups, there were more women than men, and the mean age and BMI did not differ significantly. Since 2014, jejunojejunostomy was performed extracorporeally and the mean operation time was shorter in Group 1 (258.5±52.9 min) and Group 2 (236.2±62.9 min) than Group 3 (395.2±85.9 min). [p=0.00 (1 vs 3), 0.00 (2 vs 3)] The median hospital stay was 7 days in Group 1 and 2, and shorter than 9 days in Group 3. [p=0.00 (1 vs 3), 0.011 (2 vs 3)] In Group 1, there were three postoperative complications, which included cholangitis, bile leakage and umbilical herniation, respectively). In Group 2, there were seven of postoperative complications, which included choledochojejunostomy site stricture & intrahepatic duct stone, choledochojejunostomy site stone, jejunal branch bleeding, portal vein thrombus, acute pancreatitis, adhesive ileus, and A-loop syndrome. In Group 3, there were three of postoperative complications, which included 2 hepaticojejunostomy site stricture and 1 paralytic ileus. Conclusions Robot-assisted resection of a choledochal cyst with Roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy is a safe and feasible approach with short-term results that are comparable to those of laparoscopic surgery.\"\n",

      "\"How resilient is the United States’ food system to pandemics?Rarely have studies focused on the second- and third-order effects of pandemics. Limiting the disruption of critical infrastructures during a pandemic is important for the survival and health of society (i.e., electricity, water, and food) as most medical and public health responses to a pandemic depend on these infrastructures. The studies that have looked at this issue have highlighted alarming gaps in preparedness. This study used a system dynamics model to demonstrate the likely effects of a pandemic on the USA’s food system. The model reveals that a severe pandemic with greater than a 25 % reduction in labor availability can create significant and widespread food shortages. The Ebola epidemic that began in 2014 has caused severe food shortages in West Africa, which are similar to the effects that this model predicts in the USA. The likely effects of the reduction in the amount of available food are difficult to specifically predict; however, it is likely to have severe negative consequences on society. The resilience of the food system must be improved against this hazard and others.

      "\"Robust Neural Automated Essay Scoring Using Item Response TheoryAutomated essay scoring (AES) is the task of automatically assigning scores to essays as an alternative to human grading. Conventional AES methods typically rely on manually tuned features, which are laborious to effectively develop. To obviate the need for feature engineering, many deep neural network (DNN)-based AES models have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. DNN-AES models require training on a large dataset of graded essays. However, assigned grades in such datasets are known to be strongly biased due to effects of rater bias when grading is conducted by assigning a few raters in a rater set to each essay. Performance of DNN models rapidly drops when such biased data are used for model training. In the fields of educational and psychological measurement, item response theory (IRT) models that can estimate essay scores while considering effects of rater characteristics have recently been proposed. This study therefore proposes a new DNN-AES framework that integrates IRT models to deal with rater bias within training data. To our knowledge, this is a first attempt at addressing rating bias effects in training data, which is a crucial but overlooked problem.\"\n",

      "\"A Modular Vaccine Platform Combining Self‐Assembled Peptide Cages and Immunogenic PeptidesSubunit vaccines use delivery platforms to present minimal antigenic components for immunization. The benefits of such systems include multivalency, self‐adjuvanting properties, and more specific immune responses. Previously, the design, synthesis, and characterization of self‐assembling peptide cages (SAGEs) have been reported. In these, de novo peptides are combined to make hubs that assemble into nanoparticles when mixed in aqueous solution. Here it is shown that SAGEs are nontoxic particles with potential as accessible synthetic peptide scaffolds for the delivery of immunogenic components. To this end, SAGEs functionalized with the model antigenic peptides tetanus toxoid(632‐651) and ovalbumin(323‐339) drive antigen‐specific responses both in vitro and in vivo, eliciting both CD4(+) T cell and B cell responses. Additionally, SAGEs functionalized with the antigenic peptide hemagglutinin(518‐526) from the influenza virus are also able to drive a CD8(+) T cell response in vivo. This work demonstrates the potential of SAGEs to act as a modular scaffold for antigen delivery, capable of inducing and boosting specific and tailored immune responses.\"\n",

      "\"Modelling SARS-COV2 Spread in London: Approaches to Lift the LockdownOBJECTIVE: To use mathematical models to predict the epidemiological impact of lifting the lockdown in London, UK, and alternative strategies to help inform policy in the UK. METHODS: A mathematical model for the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in London. The model was parametrised using data on notified cases, deaths, contacts, and mobility to analyse the epidemic in the UK capital. We investigated the impact of multiple non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and combinations of these measures on future incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS: Immediate action at the early stages of an epidemic in the affected districts would have tackled spread. While an extended lockdown is highly effective, other measures such as shielding older populations, universal testing and facemasks can all potentially contribute to a reduction of infections and deaths. However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown. In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown. This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections.

      "\"Are there any differences in clinical and laboratory findings on admission between H1N1 positive and negative patients with flu-like symptoms?BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization alert for the H1N1 influenza pandemic led to the implementation of certain measures regarding admission of patients with flu-like symptoms. All these instructions were adopted by the Greek National Health System. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the characteristics of all subjects admitted to the Unit of Infectious Diseases with symptoms indicating H1N1 infection, and to identify any differences between H1N1 positive or negative patients. Patients from the ED (emergency department) with flu-like symptoms (sore throat, cough, rhinorhea, or nasal congestion) and fever >37.5°C were admitted in the Unit of Infectious diseases and gave pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Swabs were tested with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). FINDINGS: Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised 33 H1N1 positive patients and Group B (control group) comprised of 27 H1N1 negative patients. The two groups did not differ in terms of patient age, co-morbidities, length of hospitalization, temperature elevation, hypoxemia, as well as renal and liver function. There were also no significant differences in severity on admission. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mean 12.8 vs. 5.74) and white blood count (WBC) (mean 10.528 vs. 7.114) were significantly higher in group B than in group A upon admission. Obesity was noted in 8 patients of Group A (mean 31.67) and 14 patients of Group B (mean 37.78). Body mass index (BMI) was lower in H1N1 positive than in H1N1 negative patients (mean 31.67 vs. 37.78, respectively; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in both groups were young male adults. CRP, WBC and BMI were higher among H1N1 negative patients. Finally, clinical course of patients in both groups was mild and uneventful.\"\n",

      "\"Severe air pollution events not avoided by reduced anthropogenic activities during COVID-19 outbreakAbstract Due to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, almost all avoidable activities in China are prohibited since Wuhan announced lockdown on January 23, 2020. With reduced activities, severe air pollution events still occurred in the North China Plain, causing discussions regarding why severe air pollution was not avoided. The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was applied during January 01 to February 12, 2020 to study PM2.5 changes under emission reduction scenarios. The estimated emission reduction case (Case 3) better reproduced PM2.5. Compared with the case without emission change (Case 1), Case 3 predicted that PM2.5 concentrations decreased by up to 20% with absolute decreases of 5.35, 6.37, 9.23, 10.25, 10.30, 12.14, 12.75, 14.41, 18.00 and 30.79 μg/m3 in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, respectively. In high-pollution days with PM2.5 greater than 75 μg/m3, the reductions of PM2.5 in Case 3 were 7.78, 9.51, 11.38, 13.42, 13.64, 14.15, 14.42, 16.95 and 22.08 μg/m3 in Shanghai, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, Beijing, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Tianjin, Zhengzhou and Wuhan, respectively. The reductions in emissions of PM2.5 precursors were ~2 times of that in concentrations, indicating that meteorology was unfavorable during simulation episode. A further analysis shows that benefits of emission reductions were overwhelmed by adverse meteorology and severe air pollution events were not avoided. This study highlights that large emissions reduction in transportation and slight reduction in industrial would not help avoid severe air pollution in China, especially when meteorology is unfavorable. More efforts should be made to completely avoid severe air pollution.\"\n",

      "\"Efficacy of minimally invasive surgery in diagnosis of interstitial lung disease.OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of video-assisted thoracic surgery in reaching a specific diagnosis in patients with interstitial lung disease. METHODS Thirty-eight patients with interstitial lung disease (19 males, 19 females; mean age 47.73 years) who had undergone video-assisted thoracic surgery at Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, between 2010 and 2013 were evaluated retrospectively in this study. Preoperative evaluations including cardiac and pulmonary assessments were performed. Data were recorded in forms prepared for this study and included age, sex, symptoms, imaging findings, operation duration, chest drain withdrawal time, postoperative hospital stay, hospital mortality, and specific diagnosis of the disease. RESULTS The most common symptom was dyspnea (38 patients, 100%). The most common computed tomography finding was a reticular pattern (30 patients, 78.94%). Surgery complications included persistent air leak in 3 (7.9%) cases and wound infection in 2 (5.26%). There was no hospital death and no need for reoperation. The average of operative time was 50 min. The mean time for chest drain withdrawal and postoperative hospitalization was 4 and 5 days, respectively. The most common diagnoses were usual interstitial pneumonia in 9 (23.68%) patients and sarcoidosis in 6 (15.78%). A specific diagnosis was not reached in 2/38 (5.26%) patients after video-assisted thoracic surgery. CONCLUSION Video-assisted thoracic surgery is a highly effective and safe method for establishing a specific diagnosis in patients with interstitial lung disease.\"\n",

Considering the importance of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, we decided to evaluate genomes of all coronaviruses sequenced to date (stated more broadly, the order Nidovirales) to determine if they contain noncanonical nucleic acid structures. We discovered much evidence of putative G-quadruplex sites and even much more of inverted repeats (IRs) loci, which in fact are ubiquitous along the whole genomic sequence and indicate a possible mechanism for genomic RNA packaging. The most notable enrichment of IRs was found inside 5′UTR for IRs of size 12+ nucleotides, and the most notable enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3′UTR, inside 5′UTR, and before mRNA. This indicates crucial regulatory roles for both IRs and PQSs. Moreover, we found multiple G-quadruplex binding motifs in human proteins having potential for binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Noncanonical nucleic acids structures in Nidovirales and in novel SARS-CoV-2 are therefore promising druggable structures that can be targeted and utilized in the future.\"\n",

      "\"Dual infection of gnotobiotic calves with bovine strains of group A and porcine-like group C rotaviruses influences pathogenesis of the group C rotavirus.There is serological evidence that bovine group C rotaviruses exist in the United States, but there are no reports of their isolation. Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive only by RT-PCR, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney (MA104) cells (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses. Thus, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or combined with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or with limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (n = 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (n = 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (n = 3) developed diarrhea but did not shed either virus. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more-widespread small intestinal lesions occurred in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses enhanced fecal shedding of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines. Thus, our findings suggest a potential novel hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.\"\n",

      "\"Management of Antimicrobial Agents in Abdominal Organ Transplant Patients in Intensive Care UnitPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Early diagnosis of infections and immediate initiation of appropriate antimicrobials are crucial in the management of patients before and after organ transplantation. We reviewed the most recent literature and guidelines in this field and organized the current recommendations for healthcare professionals caring for critically ill organ transplant recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms is increasing. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria comprise about 14% of organisms. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci bloodstream infections are also on the rise, as 20.5% of nosocomial enterococci are now vancomycin-resistant, changing empiric antibiotic selection. Fluconazole-resistant Candida species comprise up to 46% of cases of candidemia in hospitalized patients. Consequently, new guidelines recommend primary use of echinocandins in patients with candidemia who have moderate-to-severe disease. Finally, the incidence of emergence of ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infection in patients is 5–12%, requiring early recognition and change to alternative regimens in the case of poor response to therapy. SUMMARY: Bloodstream infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in solid organ transplantation. Mortality as high as 24% and 50% have been reported with sepsis and septic shock respectively. As such, bloodstream infections should be diagnosed rapidly and intravenous antibiotics should be started immediately. Appropriate resuscitation should be initiated and the number and/or dose of immunosuppressive drugs should be reduced. Proper source control must also be achieved with radiologic drainage or surgical intervention as appropriate. Initial antibiotic treatment of these patients should cover both Gram-positive organisms, especially in the presence of intravascular catheters, and Gram-negative bacteria. Echinocandins like caspofungin should also be considered especially in critically ill patients, particularly if a patient has been on total parenteral nutrition or broad-spectrum antibiotics.\"\n",

      "\"Zika virus infection as a cause of congenital brain abnormalities and Guillain-Barré syndrome: systematic reviewThe World Health Organization stated in March 2016 that there was scientific consensus that the mosquito-borne Zika virus was a cause of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome and of microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities, based on rapid evidence assessments. Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were: to update and re-assess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and b) Guillain-Barré syndrome in any population; and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality. The study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in 10 dimensions; temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response, animal experiments, analogy, specificity and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, a multidisciplinary panel of experts assessed the review findings and reached consensus on causality. We found 1091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of 10 causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity) we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For Guillain-Barré syndrome, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified non-systematically from May 30-July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that: a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including 61 microcephaly; and b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or Guillain-Barré syndrome but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible co-factors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research. Rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed, both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge. This rapid systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of Guillain-Barré situation.\"\n",

Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1–7). Our findings suggest that R(t) decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R(t) reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.\"\n",

The cats were grouped into seven categories based upon the diagnosis suggested by results of MRI, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and other diagnostic procedures: neoplastic (n =25), inflammatory or infectious (n =13), traumatic (n =8), vascular (n =6), degenerative (n =5), anomalous (n =3) and those with an unremarkable MRI (n =32). There were two independent predictors of abnormal MRI findings: severity of clinical signs and presence of spinal pain. Abnormal MRI findings and speed of onset of disease were significantly associated with survival. For the 32 cats with unremarkable MRI findings, only nine died due to spinal disease and, therefore, the median survival time (MST) was not reached (lower 95% confidence interval (CI)=970 days).

The algorithm allows to reduce the expected number of features used by an operating cascade—a key quantity we focus on in the paper. While searching, we observe suitable lower bounds on partial expectations and prune tree branches that cannot improve the best-so-far result. Both exact and approximate variants of the approach are formulated. Experiments pertain to cascades trained to be face or letter detectors with Haar-like features or Zernike moments being the input information, respectively.

      "\"Genomics, Endoscopy, and Control of Gastroesophageal Cancers: A Perspective.In The Cancer Genome Atlas the goals were to define how to treat advanced cancers with targeted therapy. However, the challenges facing cancer interception for early detection and prevention include length bias in which current screening and surveillance approaches frequently miss rapidly progressing cancers that then present at advanced stages in the clinic with symptoms (underdiagnosis). In contrast, many early detection strategies detect benign conditions that may never progress to cancer during a lifetime, and the patient dies of unrelated causes (overdiagnosis). This challenge to cancer interception is believed to be due to the speed at which the neoplasm evolves, called length bias sampling; rapidly progressing cancers are missed by current early detection strategies. In contrast, slowly or non-progressing cancers or their precursors are selectively detected. This has led to the concept of cancer interception, which can be defined as active interception of a biological process that drives cancer development before the patient presents in the clinic with an advanced, symptomatic cancer. The solutions needed to advance strategies for cancer interception require assessing the rate at which the cancer evolves over time and space. This is an essential challenge that needs to be addressed by robust study designs including normal and non-progressing controls when known to be appropriate.\"\n",

In this study the development of a real-time TaqMan® RT-PCR targeting the highly conserved nucleocapsid (N) gene of IBV and including an internal PCR control is described. The assay was specific for IBV and did not detect other avian pathogens, including turkey coronaviruses. A comparative limit of detection was determined for M41, an embryo-adapted strain, and IS/885/00, a poorly embryo-adapted variant. For M41 real-time RT-PCR and virus isolation were one or two times more sensitive than RT-PCR targeting the N or spike glycoprotein (S1) genes, respectively. For IS/885/00, real-time RT-PCR was more sensitive by tenfold than virus isolation and 30- or 40-fold than by N gene or S1 gene RT-PCR, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR and virus isolation were 17–75% more sensitive than RT-PCR targeting the S1 gene for testing tracheal swabs directly from experimentally infected chicks. When tracheal and cloacal swabs from clinical specimens were tested directly, 50% more samples were positive by real-time RT-PCR than by the S1 gene RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR targeting the N gene is more sensitive than common diagnostic assays, allowing rapid and accurate IBV detection directly from clinical specimens, facilitating differential diagnosis.\"\n",

However, there is not a consensus that the added expense of this technique necessitates monitoring in all stages of surgical management. METHODS A retrospective review of 180 surgical cases of 30 patients with EOS from July 2003 to July 2012 was performed. All monitoring alerts as judged by the neuromonitoring team were identified. Both somatosensory-evoked potentials and transcranial electric motor-evoked potentials were studied and no limiting thresholds for reporting electrophysiological changes were deemed appropriate. RESULTS Of 150 monitored cases there were 18 (12%) monitoring alerts. This represented 40% of the patient cohort over the 9-year study period. CONCLUSIONS Index versus routine lengthening rate of alerts showed no significant difference in incidence of monitoring alerts. Conversely, several patients whose primary implantation surgeries were uneventful had monitoring alerts later in their treatment course. Intraoperative neuromonitoring is warranted throughout all stages of surgical management of EOS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV. This study is a retrospective review of surgical cases of 30 patients with EOS.\"\n",

      "\"Legitimacy building and e-commerce platform development in China: The experience of AlibabaAbstract Although existing studies have connected the emergence and development of e-commerce with infrastructure, culture, and regulations, we approach technological and platform acceptance from the perspective of legitimacy building. In our study, legitimacy is categorized into market, relational, and social legitimacy, and the link between each type of legitimacy and acceptance is explored. We select the case of Alibaba and argue that Alibaba was especially competent in building legitimacy. Alibaba's continuous efforts to build legitimacy facilitated platform evolution despite its exposed weakness in intellectual property rights. These efforts rendered Alibaba as a de facto standard e-business model. This research suggests that any firm that wants market acceptance for its platform or e-commerce technology should focus more on building legitimacy among stakeholders than on anything else.\"\n",

      "\"Modelling the impact of migration on the HIV epidemic in South Africa.OBJECTIVE To use observed data to develop a mathematical model that estimates the impact of migration on the spread of HIV in South Africa. METHODS A deterministic mathematical model was designed to evaluate the dynamic interactions between mobility, sexual behaviour, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections. The model was based on a population study of 488 adults, which included male migrants, male non-migrants and their rural partners in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa. RESULTS The model predicted that the impact of migration depends upon the epidemic's stage and the pattern of migration. Early in the epidemic, frequent migration between populations with different HIV prevalence rates accelerated HIV spread; however, local sexual risk behaviour determined the eventual scale of the epidemic. If migration is coupled with increased sexual risk behaviour by migrant men, as has been reported in the South African communities studied, HIV prevalence would increase 10 times among migrants' female partners (1.8 to 19%). In contrast, if migration were to occur infrequently, with migration-associated risk behaviour assumed to be at current levels, the predicted epidemic would be one fifth that currently observed (2.8 versus 15.1%). CONCLUSIONS Migration primarily influences HIV spread by increasing high-risk sexual behaviour, rather than by connecting areas of low and high risk. Frequent return of migrants is an important risk factor when coupled with increased sexual risk behaviour. Accordingly, intervention programmes in South Africa need to target the sexual behaviour of short-term migrants specifically, even though these individuals may be more difficult to identify.\"\n",

      "\"New starch-based radiotracer for lung perfusion scintigraphy.PURPOSE In order to avoid the microbiological risks linked to human serum albumin macroaggregates (MAA) used for lung perfusion scintigraphy, we developed a new starch-based Tc-99m potential radiopharmaceutical. METHODS Microparticles were prepared from oxidised starch coupled to natural polyamine for Tc-99m complexation. Suspensions were formulated as ready-to-use kits for easy one-step labelling procedures. RESULTS Particle-size analysis, electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy were performed for microparticle characterisation, and gave a typical size distribution ranging from 7 to 63 microm, with a homogenous population of spherical or oval-shaped microparticles. Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and was stable for at least 8 h. When challenged with histidine and human plasma, labelling was also stable. Dynamic scintigraphic acquisitions and biodistribution studies conducted on healthy Wistar rats showed a tracer accumulation with more than 80% of the ID in the lungs after 15 min. CONCLUSIONS With clinically significant characteristics such as a lung half-life of 3 h, a lung-to-vascular ratio of 900, and a lung-to-liver ratio of 90, starch-based microparticles exhibit all the qualities for an effective new lung perfusion agent.\"\n",

METHODS The two truncated fragments of S gene were separately cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-15b and expressed in E.coli. The resulting recombinant proteins, rS(a) and rS(b), were purified by affinity chromatography. The full-length S gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pSecTagB to prepare recombinant plasmid pSecS as the DNA vaccine to immunize BALB/c mice for inducing the secretion of anti-SARS-CoV protein. The immunological effect of anti-SARS-CoV antibody was tested with purified rS(a) and rS(b) proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS Both the truncated recombinant proteins were expressed in soluble forms and reacted specifically with the sera from immunized pSecS mice and clinically diagnosed SARS patients. The prokaryotically expressed recombinant truncated S protein had similar antigenicity with SARS-CoV S protein. CONCLUSION The recombinant protein could be used as an antigen for detecting the serum of SARS CoV-infected patients. The SARS-CoV S gene vaccine could induce the production of specific antibody, which offers clues for the research of SARS DNA vaccine.\"\n",

      "\"Bacterial ribonuclease binase exerts an intra-cellular anti-viral mode of action targeting viral RNAs in influenza a virus-infected MDCK-II cellsBACKGROUND: Influenza is a severe contagious disease especially in children, elderly and immunocompromised patients. Beside vaccination, the discovery of new anti-viral agents represents an important strategy to encounter seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) strains. The bacterial extra-cellular ribonuclease binase is a well-studied RNase from Bacillus pumilus. Treatment with binase was shown to improve survival of laboratory animals infected with different RNA viruses. Although binase reduced IAV titer in vitro and in vivo, the mode of action (MOA) of binase against IAV at the molecular level has yet not been studied in depth and remains elusive. METHODS: To analyze whether binase impairs virus replication by direct interaction with the viral particle we applied a hemagglutination inhibition assay and monitored the integrity of the viral RNA within the virus particle by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we used Western blot and confocal microscopy analysis to study whether binase can internalize into MDCK-II cells. By primer extension we examined the effect of binase on the integrity of viral RNAs within the cells and using a mini-genome system we explored the effect of binase on the viral expression. RESULTS: We show that (i) binase does not to attack IAV particle-protected viral RNA, (ii) internalized binase could be detected within the cytosol of MDCK-II cells and that (iii) binase impairs IAV replication by specifically degrading viral RNA species within the infected MDCK-II cells without obvious effect on cellular mRNAs. CONCLUSION: Our data provide novel evidence suggesting that binase is a potential anti-viral agent with specific intra-cellular MOA.

This step is initiated by the recognition of receptors present on the host cell surface. Receptors can be major determinants of tropism, host range, and pathogenesis. Identifying virus receptors can give clues to these aspects and can lead to the design of intervention strategies. Interfering with receptor recognition is an attractive antiviral therapy, since it occurs before the viral genome has reached the relative safe haven within the cell.

      "\"Global COVID-19 transmission rate is influenced by precipitation seasonality and the speed of climate temperature warmingThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a rapidly spreading worldwide epidemic; thus, it is a global priority to reduce the speed of the epidemic spreading. Several studies predicted that high temperature and humidity could reduce COVID-19 transmission. However, exceptions exist to this observation, further thorough examinations are thus needed for their confirmation. In this study, therefore, we used a global dataset of COVID-19 cases and global climate databases and comprehensively investigated how climate parameters could contribute to the growth rate of COVID-19 cases while statistically controlling for potential confounding effects using spatial analysis. We also confirmed that the growth rate decreased with the temperature; however, the growth rate was affected by precipitation seasonality and warming velocity rather than temperature. In particular, a lower growth rate was observed for a higher precipitation seasonality and lower warming velocity. These effects were independent of population density, human life quality, and travel restrictions. The results indicate that the temperature effect is less important compared to these intrinsic climate characteristics, which might thus be useful for explaining the exceptions. However, the contributions of the climate parameters to the growth rate were moderate; rather, the contribution of travel restrictions in each country was more significant. Although our findings are preliminary owing to data-analysis limitations, they may be helpful when predicting COVID-19 transmission.\"\n",

      "\"Virtual screening for the discovery of bioactive natural productsIn this survey the impact of the virtual screening concept is discussed in the field of drug discovery from nature. Confronted by a steadily increasing number of secondary metabolites and a growing number of molecular targets relevant in the therapy of human disorders, the huge amount of information needs to be handled. Virtual screening filtering experiments already showed great promise for dealing with large libraries of potential bioactive molecules. It can be utilized for browsing databases for molecules fitting either an established pharmacophore model or a three dimensional (3D) structure of a macromolecular target. However, for the discovery of natural lead candidates the application of this in silico tool has so far almost been neglected. There are several reasons for that. One concerns the scarce availability of natural product (NP) 3D databases in contrast to synthetic libraries; another reason is the problematic compatibility of NPs with modern robotized high throughput screening (HTS) technologies. Further arguments deal with the incalculable availability of pure natural compounds and their often too complex chemistry. Thus research in this field is time-consuming, highly complex, expensive and ineffective. Nevertheless, naturally derived compounds are among the most favorable source of drug candidates. A more rational and economic search for new lead structures from nature must therefore be a priority in order to overcome these problems. Here we demonstrate some basic principles, requirements and limitations of virtual screening strategies and support their applicability in NP research with already performed studies. A sensible exploitation of the molecular diversity of secondary metabolites however asks for virtual screening concepts that are interfaced with well-established strategies from classical pharmacognosy that are used in an effort to maximize their efficacy in drug discovery. Such integrated virtual screening workflows are outlined here and shall help to motivate NP researchers to dare a step towards this powerful in silico tool.\"\n",

      "\"A new approach to determine the results of minimally invasive pulmonary vein isolation using a continuous loop monitor: preliminary results.OBJECTIVES Surgical ablation is a well-known treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF); however, little is known about the absolute success rate. The aim of this study is to compare the absolute pre- and postoperative incidence of AF after minimally invasive surgical ablation for paroxysmal AF. METHODS Twenty consecutive patients (mean age 55 ± 8; 55% male) received a continuous loop monitor (CLM) 4 weeks prior to a minimally invasive pulmonary vein isolation (MIPVI). The mean preoperative AF burden was compared with the mean AF burden during follow-up. Follow-up was achieved for a period of 12 months. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent an MIPVI successfully. Two patients did not reach the threshold for surgery. In 1 patient, surgery was discontinued because of a perioperative bleeding due to adhesions after a previous percutaneous AF ablation. Mean AF burden preoperatively was 66%. After 12 months, there was an absolute reduction in AF burden of 65% (95% CI 42-88, P < 0.001) and 12 of 15 patients in follow-up (80%) were free of AF without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). CONCLUSIONS The use of a CLM in the follow-up of surgical ablation is a very accurate way to confirm absolute surgical results. Furthermore, with the use of a CLM, preoperative evaluation can be done more accurately, and the surgical procedure can be adjusted to the patients' needs.\"\n",

Background Rhinovirus is a recognized cause of common cold and has been shown to cause asthma exacerbations in adults and children. The burden of rhinovirus infections in hospitalized children has not been described in Spain. Objective To describe confirmed rhinovirus infections in children hospitalized for respiratory tract infection in a secondary public hospital. Patients and methods We performed a prospective descriptive study in children admitted to hospital with fever or respiratory tract infection and with a positive isolation of rhinovirus in nasopharyngeal washings between September 2004 and July 2005. Virological diagnosis was made with direct immunofluorescent assay and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in specimens obtained from nasopharyngeal washings. The clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed. Results There were 76 children with rhinovirus infection, representing 25 % of admissions in 304 children with fever or respiratory tract infection. Rhinovirus was the second most frequent viral agent identified after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (29.9 % of admissions). Fifty-four children (71.1%) were under 2 years of age. The most frequent clinical diagnoses were recurrent wheezing in 60.5 %, bronchiolitis in 23.7%, pneumonia in 7.9%, and upper respiratory tract infection in 5.3 %. Fever > 38 °C was present in 57.9% of the patients and radiologic infiltrate was found in 23.7%. Oxygen saturation less than 95% was found in 43.4% of the patients. Of 22 children aged more than 2 years, a diagnosis of asthmatic crisis was made in 21. Conclusions Rhinoviruses were frequently identified in hospitalized children with respiratory tract disease and were the second most common viruses after RSV. In our series, it was the most frequent cause of recurrent wheezing in hospitalized children and the second most common cause in infants.\"\n",

      "\"Brain oxytocin: how puzzle stones from animal studies translate into psychiatryThe neuropeptide oxytocin has attracted great attention of the general public, basic neuroscience researchers, psychologists, and psychiatrists due to its profound pro-social, anxiolytic, and “anti-stress” behavioral and physiological effects, and its potential application for treatment of mental diseases associated with altered socio-emotional competence. During the last decade, substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the complex neurobiology of the oxytocin system, including oxytocinergic pathways, local release patterns, and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain, as well as intraneuronal oxytocin receptor signaling. However, the picture of oxytocin actions remains far from being complete, and the central question remains: “How does a single neuropeptide exert such pleotropic actions?” Although this phenomenon, typical for many of about 100 identified neuropeptides, may emerge from the anatomical divergence of oxytocin neurons, their multiple central projections, distinct oxytocin-sensitive cell types in different brain regions, and multiple intraneuronal signaling pathways determining the specific cellular response, further basic studies are required. In conjunction, numerous reports on positive effects of intranasal application of oxytocin on human brain networks controlling socio-emotional behavior in health and disease require harmonic tandems of basic researchers and clinicians. During the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, oxytocin research seems central as question of social isolation-induced inactivation of the oxytocin system, and buffering effects of either activation of the endogenous system or intranasal application of synthetic oxytocin need to be thoroughly investigated.\"\n",

      "\"Three-dimensional laparoscopy for living-donor nephrectomy with vaginal extraction: The first case.INTRODUCTION Two-dimensional laparoscopy for living donor nephrectomy is the current standard of care. We report the first case of three-dimensional laparoscopy for living-donor nephrectomy with vaginal extraction. PRESENTATION OF CASE The procedure was performed in a 66-year-old woman donating his left kidney to her son with the HD S 3D column (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). Preoperative computed tomography showed one left renal artery. The warm ischemic time was 2min 20s and the operative time was 200min. There was no loss of blood and no intraoperative or postoperative complications. DISCUSSION This report demonstrates the feasibility of using 3D laparoscopy which allows for a more in-depth vision, greater overall definition of planes, better accuracy of dissection and reduced operative times, for nephrectomy with vaginal extraction for kidney donation. CONCLUSION Three-dimensional laparoscopy for living-donor nephrectomy with vaginal extraction is feasible and could become a new standard.\"\n",

During this pandemic, many hospitals have already become overwhelmed around the world and are rapidly entering crisis mode. While there are global efforts to boost personal protective equipment (PPE) production, many centers are improvising care strategies, including the implementation of technology to prevent healthcare workers' exposures and reduce the waste of invaluable PPE. Not optimizing glycemic control due to clinical inertia driven by fear or lack of supplies may lead to poor outcomes in patients with diabetes and COVID-19.

In response, many countries all over the world have used different methods to reduce the infection rate, such as including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning public events, and mostly forcing social distancing, including local and national lockdowns. In our work, we use a Monte-Carlo (MC) based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population densities using the most recent epidemic data. We test the spread of the Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each model and constraint. The main prediction of this model is that a cyclic schedule of one week without restrictions and two weeks of lockdown can help to control the virus infection. In particular, this model reduces the infection rate when accompanied by social distancing and complete isolation of symptomatic patients.\"\n",

Materials and methods Chest radiographs from 50 patients with COVID-19, and 50 control patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from prior to the emergence of the novel coronavirus were assessed by seven consultant radiologists with regards to the British Society of Thoracic Imaging guidelines. Results The findings show excellent specificity (100%) and moderate sensitivity (44%) for guideline-defined Classic/Probable COVID-19, and substantial interobserver agreement (Fleiss’ k=0.61). Fair agreement was observed for the “Indeterminate for COVID-19” (k=0.23), and “Non-COVID-19” (k=0.37) categories; furthermore, the sensitivity (0.26 and 0.14 respectively) and specificity (0.76, 0.80) of these categories for COVID-19 were not significantly different (McNemar’s test p=0.18 and p=0.67). Conclusion An amalgamation of the categories of “Indeterminate for COVID-19” and “Non-COVID-19” into a single “not classic of COVID-19” classification would improve interobserver agreement, encompass patients with a similar probability of COVID-19, and remove the possibility of labelling patients with COVID-19 as “Non-COVID-19”, which is the presenting radiographic appearance in a significant minority (14%) of patients.\"\n",

Objectives: We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, computed tomography images, and treatments of patients with COVID-19 from three different cities in China. Methods: A total of 476 patients were recruited from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020, at three hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Anhui. The patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical) according to the fifth edition of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of China. Measurements and Main Results: The incidence of comorbidities was higher in the severe (46.3%) and critical (67.1%) groups than in the moderate group (37.8%). More patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in the moderate group than in the severe and critical groups. More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group than in the moderate group. More patients received antiviral agents within the first 4 days in the moderate group than in the severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteroids in the critical and severe groups. Patients >75 years old had a significantly lower survival rate than younger patients. Conclusions: Multiple organ dysfunction and impaired immune function were the typical characteristics of patients with severe or critical illness. There was a significant difference in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers among patients with different severities of disease. Involvement of multiple lung lobes and pleural effusion were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Advanced age (≥75 yr) was a risk factor for mortality.\"\n",

METHODS 31 consecutive children with OSA following TA underwent DISE. 26 completed DISE-directed operative management of the level(s) of ongoing upper airway obstruction. Pre- and postoperative OSA were assessed through a detailed history (of nighttime symptoms (NS) and daytime symptoms (DS)), physical examination, and polysomnography. RESULTS Age ranged 5-18 years (mean 9.7 ± 3.4). Fourteen of 26 had trisomy 21 (51%). Operations were performed in the following frequencies: lingual tonsillectomy (LT) (22), midline posterior glossectomy (MPG) (16), revision adenoidectomy (11), inferior turbinate submucosal resection (7), uvulopalatoplasty (2), and supraglottoplasty (2). Overall, 92% reported subjective improvement. NS improved from 5.8 ± 2.9 preoperatively to 2.1 ± 2.5 postoperatively (p<0.05), while DS improved from 2.1 ± 1.3 preoperatively to 0.6 ± 1.1 postoperatively (p<0.05). Seventeen patients completed preoperative polysomnography, while only 11 of them also completed postoperative polysomnography. Mean OAHI fell from 7.0 (±5.8) events/hr to 3.6 (±1.8) events/hr (t-test, p=0.09).

      "\"Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Interacts With Inflammation in Human DiseasesThe endoplasmic reticulum is a critical organelle for normal cell function and homeostasis. Disturbed protein folding process in the ER, termed ER stress, leads to the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) that encompasses a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways. The UPR can either restore ER homeostasis or activate pro-apoptotic pathways depending on specific insults, intensity and duration of the stress, and cell types. ER stress and the UPR have recently been linked to inflammation in a variety of human pathologies including autoimmune diseases, infection, neurodegenerative disease, and metabolic disorders. In the cell, ER stress and inflammatory signaling share extensive regulators and effectors in a broad spectrum of biological processes. In spite of different etiologies, the two signaling pathways were shown to form a vicious cycle in exacerbating cellular dysfunction and causing apoptosis in many cells and tissues. However, the interaction between ER stress and inflammation in many of these diseases remains elusive. Further understanding of those issues may enable the development of novel therapies that spontaneously target these pathogenic pathways.\"\n",

This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography (3D-TOF-MRA) and contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) at 3 T for the evaluation of aneurysm occlusion and parent artery patency after flow diversion treatment, with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the gold standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients treated with flow diverters between January 2009 and January 2013 followed by MRA at 3 T (3D-TOF-MRA and CE-MRA) and DSA within a 48 h period were included in a prospective single-center study. Aneurysm occlusion was assessed with full and simplified Montreal scales and parent artery patency with three-grade and two-grade scales. RESULTS Twenty-two patients harboring 23 treated aneurysms were included. Interobserver agreement using simplified scales for occlusion (Montreal) and parent artery patency were higher for DSA (0.88 and 0.61) and CE-MRA (0.74 and 0.55) than for 3D-TOF-MRA (0.51 and 0.02). Intermodality agreement was higher for CE-MRA (0.88 and 0.32) than for 3D-TOF-MRA (0.59 and 0.11). CE-MRA yielded better accuracy than 3D-TOF-MRA for aneurysm remnant detection (sensitivity 83% vs 50%; specificity 100% vs 100%) and for the status of the parent artery (specificity 63% vs 32%; sensitivity 100% vs 100%). CONCLUSIONS At 3 T, CE-MRA is superior to 3D-TOF-MRA for the evaluation of aneurysm occlusion and parent artery patency after flow diversion treatment. However, intraluminal evaluation remains difficult with MRA regardless of the sequence used.\"\n",

      "\"Risk Factors for SARS Transmission from Patients Requiring Intubation: A Multicentre Investigation in Toronto, CanadaBACKGROUND: In the 2003 Toronto SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV was transmitted in hospitals despite adherence to infection control procedures. Considerable controversy resulted regarding which procedures and behaviours were associated with the greatest risk of SARS-CoV transmission. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV during intubation from laboratory confirmed SARS patients to HCWs involved in their care. All SARS patients requiring intubation during the Toronto outbreak were identified. All HCWs who provided care to intubated SARS patients during treatment or transportation and who entered a patient room or had direct patient contact from 24 hours before to 4 hours after intubation were eligible for this study. Data was collected on patients by chart review and on HCWs by interviewer-administered questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to identify risk factors for SARS transmission. RESULTS: 45 laboratory-confirmed intubated SARS patients were identified. Of the 697 HCWs involved in their care, 624 (90%) participated in the study. SARS-CoV was transmitted to 26 HCWs from 7 patients; 21 HCWs were infected by 3 patients. In multivariate GEE logistic regression models, presence in the room during fiberoptic intubation (OR = 2.79, p = .004) or ECG (OR = 3.52, p = .002), unprotected eye contact with secretions (OR = 7.34, p = .001), patient APACHE II score ≥20 (OR = 17.05, p = .009) and patient Pa0(2)/Fi0(2) ratio ≤59 (OR = 8.65, p = .001) were associated with increased risk of transmission of SARS-CoV. In CART analyses, the four covariates which explained the greatest amount of variation in SARS-CoV transmission were covariates representing individual patients. CONCLUSION: Close contact with the airway of severely ill patients and failure of infection control practices to prevent exposure to respiratory secretions were associated with transmission of SARS-CoV. Rates of transmission of SARS-CoV varied widely among patients.\"\n",

      "\"Epidemic viral pneumonia.PURPOSE OF REVIEW Two recent viral epidemics producing pneumonitis (severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza A H1N1) have highlighted the potential for viral infections to cause respiratory failure with a significant risk of mortality. This review describes these epidemics and other causes of epidemic viral pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS The recent literature highlights the rapidity with which these emerging viral infections can be characterized and how management strategies, including supportive care, antiviral therapy and infection control precautions, can be rapidly shared and implemented. SUMMARY The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak was too short to allow management protocols to be tested in a research environment. The current 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic is fortunately not associated with as high a mortality rate as the avian influenza A (H5N1), another potential pandemic candidate virus. Prior pandemic planning as well as research planning has allowed a rapid response to this outbreak, with a significant amount of literature generated in a few months. Other common seasonal viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza, as well as previously poorly recognized viruses such as hantavirus, have the ability to cause significant respiratory morbidity and mortality.\"\n",

      "\"Tannic acid facilitates expression of the polypyrimidine tract binding protein and alleviates deleterious inclusion of CHRNA1 exon P3A due to an hnRNP H-disrupting mutation in congenital myasthenic syndromeWe recently reported that the intronic splice-site mutation IVS3-8G>A of CHRNA1 that encodes the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α subunit disrupts binding of a splicing repressor, hnRNP H. This, in turn, results in exclusive inclusion of the downstream exon P3A. The P3A(+) transcript encodes a non-functional α subunit that comprises 50% of the transcripts in normal human skeletal muscle, but its functional significance remains undetermined. In an effort to search for a potential therapy, we screened off-label effects of 960 bioactive chemical compounds and found that tannic acid ameliorates the aberrant splicing due to IVS3-8G>A but without altering the expression of hnRNP H. Therefore, we searched for another splicing trans-factor. We found that the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) binds close to the 3′ end of CHRNA1 intron 3, that PTB induces skipping of exon P3A and that tannic acid increases the expression of PTB in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion assays of the PTB promoter region revealed that the tannic acid-responsive element is between positions −232 and −74 from the translation initiation site. These observations open the door to the discovery of novel therapies based on PTB overexpression and to detecting possible untoward effects of the overexpression.\"\n",

      "\"Individualized treatment based on CYP3A5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with tacrolimus in ulcerative colitis.BACKGROUND/AIMS The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus (TAC) is known to be largely influenced by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP3A5. Patients starting TAC require careful dose adjustment, owing to the wide range of optimal dosages, depending on their CYP3A5 expression status. Here, we evaluated whether individualization of TAC dosages based on CYP3A5 SNPs would improve its therapeutic efficacy in ulcerative colitis. METHODS Twenty-one patients were prospectively treated, with their initial dosage adjusted according to their CYP3A5 status (0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mg/kg/day for CYP3A5*3/*3, CYP3A5*1/*3, and CYP3A5*1/*1, respectively). Their clinical outcomes were compared with those of patients treated with a fixed dose (0.1 mg/kg/day). RESULTS The first blood trough level of CYP3A5 expressors, CYP3A5*1/*3 or CYP3A5*1/*1, and the overall rate in achieving the target blood trough level within a week in the individualized-dose group were significantly higher than those in the fixed-dose group (5.15±2.33 ng/mL vs. 9.63±0.79 ng/mL, P=0.035 and 12.5% vs. 66.7%, P=0.01). The remission rate at 2 weeks in the expressors was as high as that in the nonexpressors, CYP3A5*3/*3, in the individualized-dose group. CONCLUSIONS Individualized TAC treatment is effective against ulcerative colitis regardless of the CYP3A5 genotype.\"\n",

      "\"[Oesophageal GIST at the left tracheobronchial angle: resection with right-sided VATS].OBJECTIVE The vast majority of submucosal oesophageal tumours are leiomyomas. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) account for only one percent of all gastrointestinal malignancies, whereby an oesophageal location represents a medical rarity. Although surgical resection is the gold standard, the optimal procedure remains a matter of debate. Conventional oesophageal resection is the most common therapeutic choice to ensure complete removal with an appropriate safety margin and avoid dissemination of neoplastic cells. Anyhow, occasional case reports about enucleation of oesophageal GIST have been published. This video paper for the first time describes the use of right-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) as a technique to enucleate an oesophageal GIST within the left tracheobronchial angle. INDICATION A 68-year-old male patient was evaluated for recurrent haemoptysis and dysphagia and diagnosed with a 1.4 cm sized oesophageal tumour at the left tracheobronchial angle. CT scan showed a submucosal location without signs of invasive growth. After conducting endosonography we suspected a leiomyoma and performed minimally invasive enucleation with right-sided VATS. METHOD Employing independent lung ventilation the patient was put into a left lateral position. Four trocars were applied. After incision of the mediastinal pleura the tumour was localised with intraoperative gastroscopy and diaphanoscopy. By mobilisation of the oesophagus and transection of the azygous vein it was possible to bluntly dissect the mass from surrounding oesophageal muscular fibres and safely extract it with a specimen bag. After removal of the thoracic drainage on the first postoperative day the patient was discharged the day after. The further course was uneventful. Histological work-up showed a GIST pT1cN0M0 R0 with a Ki-67 index less than 1 % (UICC I). After 10 months of follow-up the patient is recurrence-free and shows no symptoms. CONCLUSION Enucleation of a locally limited oesophageal GIST by right-sided VATS is a feasible and safe surgical procedure with dramatically reduced invasiveness compared to conventional open oesophageal resections.\"\n",

      "\"Intracellular accumulation of punta toro virus glycoproteins expressed from cloned cDNAAbstract The Punta Toro virus (PTV) middle size (M) RNA encodes two glycoproteins, G1 and G2, and possibly a nonstructural protein, NSM. A partial cDNA clone of the M segment which contains G1 and G2 glycoprotein coding sequences but lacks most of the NSM sequences was inserted into the genome of vaccinia virus under the control of an early vaccinia promoter. Cells infected with the recombinant virus were found to synthesize two polypeptides with molecular weights of 65,000 (G1) and 55,000 (G2) that reacted specifically with antibody against PTV. Studies using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that these proteins accumulated intracellularly in the perinuclear region. The results of endoglycosidase H digestion of these glycoproteins suggested that both G1 and G2 glycoproteins were transported from the RER to the Golgi complex. These proteins were not chased out from the Golgi region during a 6-hr incubation in the presence of cycloheximide. Surface immune precipitation and 125I-protein A binding assays also demonstrated that the majority of the G1 and G2 glycoproteins are retained intracellularly. These results indicate that the PTV glycoproteins contain the necessary information for retention in the Golgi apparatus.\"\n",

Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic, the question emerges whether human-to-animal transmission is possible and if so, which animal species are most at risk. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights several important considerations when designing these computational studies and analyzing their results.\"\n",

There are no reliable data on IPC status in Tanzanian healthcare facilities; hence the Star Rating Assessment (SRA) was established to address this. This study compared the health facility performances on adherence to IPC principles using baseline and reassessment data of SRA. Methods A retrospective analysis of data from eight randomly selected regions across Tanzania. Data was gathered from an SRA database in which records of baseline assessments (2015/16) and reassessments (2017/18) were documented. Each healthcare facility’s ownership and service level were investigated as independent variables. Results A total of 2,131 healthcare facilities at baseline and 2,185 at reassessment were analysed. Median adherence to IPC principles increased from 31% (IQR: 20%, 46%) to 57% (IQR: 41.4%, 73.2%) after interventions (p<0.001). Privately-owned facilities had higher adherence to IPC principles compared to publicly-owned facilities during baseline (p<0.001) however, the difference was not significant after intervention (p=0.751). On average, hospitals scored highest followed by health centres and then dispensaries during both assessments. Being a privately-owned facility was a predictor of attaining a recommended IPC score of 80% at baseline (POR=1.92 CI=1.06-3.48) but not after the intervention. Facility level was not a predictor during baseline assessment; however after intervention hospitals were twice as likely to attain the recommended score compared to dispensaries (POR=2.27 CI=1.15-4.45) Conclusion Assessment and rating of quality and organization of health services plus management support to healthcare facilities, leads to improved adherence to IPC principles.\"\n",

      "\"Potent synthetic nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 and molecular basis for neutralizationSARS-CoV-2, the Covid-19 causative virus, adheres to human cells through binding of its envelope Spike protein to the receptor ACE2. The Spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) mediates this key event and thus is a primary target for therapeutic neutralizing antibodies to mask the ACE2-interacting interface. Here, we generated 99 synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) using ribosome and phage display. The best sybody MR3 binds the RBD with KD of 1.0 nM and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with IC50 of 0.40 μg mL-1. Crystal structures of two sybody-RBD complexes reveal a common neutralizing mechanism through which the RBD-ACE2 interaction is competitively inhibited by sybodies. The structures allowed the rational design of a mutant with higher affinity and improved neutralization efficiency by ∼24-folds, lowering the IC50 from 12.32 to 0.50 μg mL-1. Further, the structures explain the selectivity of sybodies between SARS-CoV strains. Our work presents an alternative approach to generate neutralizers against newly emerged viruses.

      "\"Short-term outcomes of laparoscopic single anastomosis gastric bypass (LSAGB) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in lower BMI (<30 kg/m(2)) patients.BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery is an efficient procedure for remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in morbid obesity. However, in Asian countries, mean body mass index (BMI) of T2DM patients is about 25 kg/m(2). Various data on patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery showed that control of T2DM after surgery occurs rapidly and somewhat independent to weight loss. We hypothesized that in non-obese patients with T2DM, the glycemic control would be achieved as a consequence of gastric bypass surgery. METHODS From September 2009, the 172 patients have had laparoscopic single anastomosis gastric bypass (LSAGB) surgery. Among them, 107 patients have been followed up more than 1 year. We analyzed the dataset of these patients. Values related to diabetes were measured before and 1, 2, and 3 years after the surgery. RESULTS The mean BMI decreased during the first year after the surgery but plateaued after that. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin level decreased continuously. The mean fasting and postglucose loading plasma glucose level also decreased. CONCLUSION After LSAGB surgery in non-obese T2DM patients, the control of T2DM was possible safely and effectively. However, longer follow-up with matched control group is essential.\"\n",

      "\"Rheumatology practice amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: a pragmatic viewThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has come with many challenges for healthcare providers and patients alike. In addition to the direct burden it has placed on societies and health systems, it had a significant impact in the care of patients with chronic diseases, as healthcare resources were deployed to fight the crisis, and major travel and social restrictions were adopted. In the field of rheumatology, this has required notable efforts from departments and clinicians to adapt to the novel status quo and assure the follow-up of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. In the present viewpoint, we provide a practical approach to tackle this reality. Key measures include setting up preventive team management strategies, optimising communication with patients and reorganising patient care in all its dimensions. We then anticipate the nuances of rheumatology practice as restrictive measures are progressively lifted, while an effective vaccine is still pending. This includes the need to reimpose the same strategy as further waves unfold. Finally, we look ahead and address the lessons we can incorporate into post-COVID-19 rheumatology.\"\n",

      "\"First full-length sequences of the S gene of European isolates reveal further diversity among turkey coronaviruses.An increasing incidence of enteric disorders clinically suggestive of the poult enteritis complex has been observed in turkeys in France since 2003. Using a newly designed real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay specific for the nucleocapsid (N) gene of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronaviruses (TCoV), coronaviruses were identified in 37% of the intestinal samples collected from diseased turkey flocks. The full-length spike (S) gene of these viruses was amplified, cloned and sequenced from three samples. The French S sequences shared 98% identity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels, whereas they were at most 65% and 60% identical with North American (NA) TCoV and at most 50% and 37% identical with IBV at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Higher divergence with NA TCoV was observed in the S1-encoding domain. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene revealed that the newly detected viruses form a sublineage genetically related with, but significantly different from, NA TCoV. Additionally, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the N gene, located on the 5' and 3' sides of the S gene in the coronavirus genome, were partially sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both the NA TCoV and French TCoV (Fr TCoV) lineages included some IBV relatives, which were however different in the two lineages. This suggested that different recombination events could have played a role in the evolution of the NA and Fr TCoV. The present results provide the first S sequence for a European TCoV. They reveal extensive genetic variation in TCoV and suggest different evolutionary pathways in North America and Europe.\"\n",

A total of 22 cattle farms (10 beef herds and 12 dairy herds) were visited once every 21 days between January and December 2000. A faecal sample was collected directly from the rectum of each of the 844 calves born during the study period. Each sample was studied macroscopically to establish its consistency as liquid, soft or solid, and the presence of mucus or blood noted. C. parvum oocysts were identified by direct microscopic examination and the intensity of infection established semiquantitatively as slight, moderate or severe. Of the 844 calves, 404 were found to have the parasite in their faeces, i.e. the prevalence was 47.9%. Statistical analysis of the risk factors such as general characteristics of the farm and the housing conditions of the calves, revealed three variables that significantly effect the risk of cryptosporidial infection in suckling calves: the method of cleaning, the type of flooring and the frequency of cleaning.\"\n",

Subsequently, experiments were undertaken to assess diagnostic criteria such as specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility. The detection limit of the real-time RT-PCR assays was 10 RNA copies per reaction mixture. No cross-reactivity was observed between RNA samples derived from designed HCoV and other HCoV or human metapneumovirus. A total of 158 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from adult patients with acute respiratory tract infection in Beijing were screened for the presence of human coronavirus NL63 and HKU1 by using real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR method. The fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR method detected six specimens positive for human coronavirus NL63, five specimens positive for human coronavirus HKU1; and conventional RT-PCR method detected three HCoV-NL63 positive and three HCoV-HKU1 positive, respectively. The convention RT-PCR products of positive samples were obtained and sequence analysis confirmed the reliability of the above methods. In summary, the real-time RT-PCR assay for HCoV- NL63 or HKU1 was more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR and with less time (less than 4 hours) for completion. It may be suitable for molecular epidemiological surveillance and clinical diagnosis for human coronavirus NL63 and HKU1.\"\n",

      "\"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a frequent complication of critically ill H1N1 patients: a retrospective studyPURPOSE: Despite their controversial role, corticosteroids (CS) are frequently administered to patients with H1N1 virus infection with severe respiratory failure secondary to viral pneumonia. We hypothesized that invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection and that CS may contribute to this complication. METHODS: We retrospectively selected all adult patients with confirmed H1N1 virus infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of two tertiary care hospitals from September 2009 to March 2011. Differences in baseline factors, risk factors, and outcome parameters were studied between patients with and without IPA. RESULTS: Of 40 critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1, 9 (23 %) developed IPA 3 days after ICU admission. Five patients had proven and four had probable IPA. Significantly more IPA patients received CS within 7 days before ICU admission (78 versus 23 %, p = 0.002). IPA patients also received significantly higher doses of CS before ICU admission [hydrocortisone equivalent 800 (360–2,635) versus 0 (0–0) mg, p = 0.005]. On multivariate analysis, use of CS before ICU admission was independently associated with IPA [odds ratio (OR) 14.4 (2.0–101.6), p = 0.007]. CONCLUSIONS: IPA was diagnosed in 23 % of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection after a median of 3 days after ICU admission. Our data suggest that use of CS 7 days before ICU admission is an independent risk factor for fungal superinfection. These findings may have consequences for clinical practice as they point out the need for increased awareness of IPA, especially in those critically ill H1N1 patients already receiving CS.\"\n",

      "\"Does transumbilical single incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding result in decreased pain medicine use? A case-matched study.BACKGROUND We report on our initial experience of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding performed through a single transumbilical incision of approximately 2.5 cm. All single incision bands were placed using the Covidien SILS Port™ and the Allergan Lap-Band(®). The purpose of the present study was to report on the analgesic use after single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) adjustable gastric banding versus that after conventional laparoscopic gastric banding at a community hospital. METHODS A retrospective review of postoperative pain medication use and the time to return to work was conducted of 24 consecutive SILS adjustable gastric banding procedures compared with 24 traditional 5-incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedures. RESULTS The patients in both groups were evenly matched for age, body mass index, and co-morbidities. All patients were discharged home on postoperative day 1. No complications developed. The mean patient-controlled analgesia morphine use during hospitalization for the SILS group was 33 ± 19.22 mg versus 49 ± 23.78 mg in the traditional group (P <.05). The mean period of postoperative pain medication use for the SILS group was 2 days versus 5 days for the traditional group (P <.05). However, the mean period to return to work was 9.5 days for the SILS group versus 11 days for the traditional group (P = NS). CONCLUSION Transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with mechanical port fixation resulted in significantly decreased postoperative pain medication use compared with traditional laparoscopic gastric banding with suture fixation of the band port. Also, the patients tended to return to work earlier after SILS gastric banding.\"\n",

      "\"Hydroxychloroquine in Patients with Rheumatic Disease Complicated by COVID-19: Clarifying Target Exposures and the Need for Clinical TrialsOBJECTIVE: To characterize hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) exposure in patients with rheumatic disease receiving longterm HCQ compared to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against the coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). METHODS: We evaluated total HCQ concentrations in serum and plasma from published literature values, frozen serum samples from a pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus trial, and simulated concentrations using a published pharmacokinetic model during pregnancy. For each source, we compared observed or predicted HCQ concentrations to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The average total serum/plasma HCQ concentrations were below the lowest SARS-CoV-2 target of 0.48 mg/l in all studies. Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/l), all studies had about one-tenth the necessary concentration for in vitro viral inhibition. Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose. CONCLUSION: We found that the average patient receiving treatment with HCQ for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Nevertheless, patients receiving HCQ long term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma. Because the therapeutic window for HCQ in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for HCQ.\"\n",

      "\"Robotic Insertion of Various Ablation Needles Under Computed Tomography Guidance: Accuracy in Animal Experiments.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the accuracy of robotic insertion of various ablation needles at various locations under computed tomography (CT) guidance in swine. MATERIALS AND METHODS The robot was used for CT-guided insertion of four ablation needles, namely a single internally cooled radiofrequency ablation (RFA) needle (Cool-tip), a multi-tined expandable RFA needle (LeVeen), a cryoablation needle (IceRod), and an internally cooled microwave ablation needle (Emprint). One author remotely operated the robot with the operation interface in order to orient and insert the needles under CT guidance. Five insertions of each type of ablation needle towards 1.0-mm targets in the liver, kidney, lung, and hip muscle were attempted on the plane of an axial CT image in six swine. Accuracy of needle insertion was evaluated as the three-dimensional length between the target centre and needle tip. The accuracy of needle insertion was compared according to the type of needle used and the location using one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS The overall mean accuracy of all four needles in all four locations was 2.8 mm. The mean accuracy of insertion of the Cool-tip needle, LeVeen needle, IceRod needle, and Emprint needle was 2.8 mm, 3.1 mm, 2.5 mm, and 2.7 mm, respectively. The mean accuracy of insertion into the liver, kidney, lung, and hip muscle was 2.7 mm, 2.9 mm, 2.9 mm, and 2.5 mm, respectively. There was no significant difference in insertion accuracy among the needles (P = .38) or the locations (P = .53). CONCLUSION Robotic insertion of various ablation needles under CT guidance was accurate regardless of type of needle or location in swine.\"\n",

      "\"A population-based analysis of emergent versus elective paraesophageal hernia repair using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.BACKGROUND As the life expectancy in the United States continues to increase, more elderly, sometimes frail patients present with sub-acute surgical conditions such as a symptomatic paraesophageal hernia (PEH). While the outcomes of PEH repair have improved largely due to the proliferation of laparoscopic surgery, there is still a defined rate of morbidity and mortality. We sought to characterize the outcomes of both elective and emergent PEH repair using a large population-based data set. METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for primary ICD-9 codes associated with PEH repair (years 2006-2008). Outcomes were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of a pre-identified complication. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for complications and mortality following both elective and emergent PEH repair. RESULTS A total of 8,462 records in the data, representing 41,723 patients in the US undergoing PEH repair in the study interval, were identified. Of these procedures, 74.2% was elective and 42.4% was laparoscopic. The overall complication and mortality rates were 20.8 and 1.1%, respectively. Emergent repair was associated with a higher rate of morbidity (33.4 vs. 16.5%, p < 0.001) and mortality (3.2 vs. 0.37%, p < 0.001) than elective repair. Emergent repair patients were more likely to be male, were older, and more likely to be minority. Logistic modeling revealed that younger age, elective case status, and a laparoscopic approach were independently associated with a lower probability of complications and mortality. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing emergent PEH repair in the United States tend to be older, more likely a racial minority, and less likely to undergo laparoscopic repair. Elective repair, younger age, and a laparoscopic approach are associated with improved outcomes. Considering all of the above, we recommend that patients consider elective repair with a surgeon experienced in the laparoscopic approach, especially when symptoms related to the hernia are present.\"\n",

      "\"Comparison of the Allplex(TM) Respiratory Panel Assays and the automated Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory pathogens 21 assay for the diagnosis of pediatric respiratory viral infectionsAcute respiratory tract infections frequently occur in children and represent one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Quick and accurate pathogen detection can lead to a more appropriate use of antimicrobial treatment as well as timely implementation of isolation precautions. In the last decade, several commercial assays have been developed for the simultaneous diagnosis of respiratory pathogens, which substantially vary in formulation and performance characteristics. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the “Allplex(TM) Respiratory Panel Assays” (Seegene) with that of the automated “Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory pathogens 21” assay (Siemens) for the diagnosis of pediatric respiratory viral infections. One hundred forty-five nasopharyngeal wash samples, collected at the Bambino Gesù Pediatric Hospital in Rome during the fall-winter 2017-2018 season, were processed and analyzed with both workflows. Our results suggest a high concordance between the two methods for positive and negative samples. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated with both tests as a reference method. For the Allplex(TM) Respiratory Panel Assays, they were 98% and 100%, respectively, and for the Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory pathogens 21 assay, they were both 100%. This comparative study allowed us to highlight the characteristics of the two assays to evaluate the best solution, on the basis of diagnostic routine and laboratory workflows, keeping in mind local epidemiology.\"\n",

      "\"Mumps Outbreak—Colorado, 2017BACKGROUND: During 2016, an unusually high number (>5,000) of mumps cases were reported in the United States. On January 20, 2017, we identified a mumps outbreak in the Denver metropolitan area among a Marshallese community. We performed active surveillance to assess outbreak magnitude and guide implementation of control measures. METHODS: On January 22, local and state health departments initiated active case surveillance by using a church-based community roster. Each household was contacted by telephone ≥3 times to identify mumps cases, according to the 2012 CDC/Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition, and risk factors (e.g., household size). Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination status was reviewed in the Colorado Immunization Information System (CIIS). Four church-based vaccination clinics were held to bring participants up-to-date for MMR vaccination. Targeted messaging about mumps, MMR vaccine, and vaccination clinics was distributed through social media, churches, and Marshallese-language radio. RESULTS: Of the 21 households on the church roster, 17 were successfully contacted, 13 of which (76%) provided data for 85 persons (median household size: 6 persons; range: 5–12). Through household interviews and laboratory reporting, we identified 47 mumps cases (17 confirmed; 30 probable). Median patient age was 20 years (range: 3 months–44 years), 24 (51%) were male, and 34 (72%) reported no or unknown prior mumps vaccination and had no MMR vaccination documented in CIIS. During vaccination clinics, 118 (80%) of 148 presenting Marshallese persons were eligible for and received MMR vaccine; of those vaccinated, median age was 21 years (range: 1–55 years) and 104 (88%) had no prior MMR vaccine documentation. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance, facilitated through culturally appropriate communication with church leaders, helped identify cases, disseminate materials, and promote MMR vaccination. Household interviews provided timely data to define outbreak magnitude and need for urgent MMR vaccination. DISCLOSURES: All authors: No reported disclosures. sdsdsdsd\"\n",

      "\"Autologous fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseaseThe term autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (a-FMT) refers herein to the use of one's feces during a healthy state for later use to restore gut microbial communities after perturbations. Generally, heterologous fecal microbiota transplantation (h-FMT), where feces from a ``healthy” donor is transplanted into a person with illness, has been used to treat infectious diseases such as recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), with cure rates of up to 90%. In humans, due to limited response to medicines, h-FMT has become a hallmark intervention to treat CDI. Extrapolating the benefits from CDI, h-FMT has been attempted in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but clinical response has been variable and less effective (ranging between 24% and 50%). Differences in h-FMT clinical response could be because CDI is caused by a Clostridial infection, whereas IBD is a complex, microbiome-driven immunological inflammatory disorder that presents predominantly within the gut wall of genetically-susceptible hosts. FMT response variability could also be due to differences in microbiome composition between donors, recipients, and within individuals, which vary with diet, and environments, across regions. While donor selection has emerged as a key factor in FMT success, the use of heterologous donor stool still places the recipient at risk of exposure to infectious/pathogenic microorganisms. As an implementable solution, herein we review the available literature on a-FMT, and list some considerations on the benefits of a-FMT for IBD.\"\n",

      "\"Changes in cardiac output and cerebral oxygenation during prone and supine sleep positioning in healthy term infants.OBJECTIVE To investigate the changes in systemic and cerebral haemodynamics between supine and prone sleep in healthy term infants during the early postnatal period. DESIGN/METHODS Healthy term infants without congenital anomalies, patent ductus arteriosus and/or small for gestational age status were enrolled. Infants were placed in supine (SP1), prone (PP) and back in supine (SP2) position for 15 min each while asleep. Cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were assessed by electrical velocimetry (EV) and echocardiography (echo), and cerebral regional oxygen saturation (CrSO2) in the frontal lobes was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. Heart rate (HR) and SpO2 were continuously monitored by conventional monitoring. RESULTS In 34 healthy term infants (mean age 3.7±1.2 days; 16 females), 66 sets of serial CO measurements (34 EV and 32 echo) in three sleep positions were obtained. Mean COEV and COecho were 182±57 (SP1), 170±50 (PP) and 177±54 (SP2), and 193±48 (SP1), 174±40 (PP) and 192±50 (SP2) mL/kg/min, respectively. Mean SVEV and SVecho were 1.46±0.47 (SP1), 1.36±0.38 (PP) and 1.37±0.39 (SP2), and 1.54±40 (SP1), 1.38±0.38 (PP) and 1.51±0.41 (SP2) mL/kg, respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a decrease in CO and SV during prone positions by both EV and echo, while HR, SpO2 and CrSO2 did not change. Thirty-eight per cent of the CO measurements decreased≥10% during prone positioning. CONCLUSIONS In healthy term infants, CO decreases in prone position due to a decrease in SV and not HR. CO recovers when placed back in supine. However, frontal lobe CrSO2 does not change in the different positions.\"\n",

Lowered gluteal muscle oxygenation (SgmO2) may be demonstrated by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Purpose To evaluate NIRS-determined SgmO2 in EVAR patients. Material and Methods NIRS-determined SgmO2 was used in an observational study design (n = 17). From the ambulatory setting, seven EVAR patients were included with reported gluteal claudication from medical records. In 10 patients scheduled for EVAR, SgmO2 was measured before and after the procedure. NIRS sensors were applied bilaterally on the gluteal region. Treadmill walking (12% incline, 2.4 km/h) was introduced to stress gluteal muscles. Results A reduced SgmO2 with regional side difference (P < 0.05) was noted in all 10 patients following EVAR and four reported gluteal claudication. In patients with gluteal claudication (n = 7), treadmill decreased SgmO2. The time to recover the SgmO2 was prolonged for tissue exposed to occluded hypogastric artery (median = 512 s, range = 73-1207 s vs. median = 137, range = 0-643 s; P = 0.046).

In order to identify specific characteristics of Mu-3, the pathology of Mu-3-infected mice was compared with that of srr7- and cl-2-infected mice. The neuropathology after Mu-3 infection exhibited a mixed pattern comparable to that induced by srr7 and cl-2 infections. In addition, Mu-3 infection caused marked apoptotic lesions in the hippocampal region, particularly in the CA2 and CA3 subregions, in the brains of all infected mice. In contrast, in cl-2 infection, 10-20% of the infected mice exhibited apoptosis in the hippocampus, which was primarily observed in the CA1 subregion. Apoptosis also occurred in the pyramidal neurons and CD11b-bearing cells. The apoptotic cells, indicated by caspase 3-activation, were a mixed population of infected and a higher number of uninfected cells. These data indicated that apoptosis observed in Mu-3 infection could be induced by the indirect effects of infection in addition to direct effects of the infected cells occurring in a cell-autonomous manner.\"\n",

      "\"The M, E, and N structural proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus are required for efficient assembly, trafficking, and release of virus-like particles.The production of virus-like particles (VLPs) constitutes a relevant and safe model to study molecular determinants of virion egress. The minimal requirement for the assembly of VLPs for the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans (SARS-CoV) is still controversial. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV VLP formation depends on either M and E proteins or M and N proteins. Here we show that both E and N proteins must be coexpressed with M protein for the efficient production and release of VLPs by transfected Vero E6 cells. This suggests that the mechanism of SARS-CoV assembly differs from that of other studied coronaviruses, which only require M and E proteins for VLP formation. When coexpressed, the native envelope trimeric S glycoprotein is incorporated onto VLPs. Interestingly, when a fluorescent protein tag is added to the C-terminal end of N or S protein, but not M protein, the chimeric viral proteins can be assembled within VLPs and allow visualization of VLP production and trafficking in living cells by state-of-the-art imaging technologies. Fluorescent VLPs will be used further to investigate the role of cellular machineries during SARS-CoV egress.\"\n",

      "\"Lung volume recruitment in a preterm pig model of lung immaturity.A translational preterm pig model analogous to infants born at 28 wk of gestation revealed that continuous positive airway pressure results in limited lung recruitment but does not prevent respiratory distress syndrome, whereas assist-control + volume guarantee (AC+VG) ventilation improves recruitment but can cause injury, highlighting the need for improved ventilation strategies. We determined whether airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) can be used to recruit the immature lungs of preterm pigs without injury. Spontaneously breathing pigs delivered at 89% of term (model for 28-wk infants) were randomized to 24 h of APRV (n = 9) vs. AC+VG with a tidal volume of 5 ml/kg (n = 10). Control pigs (n = 36) were provided with supplemental oxygen by an open mask. Nutrition and fluid support was provided throughout the 24-h period. All pigs supported with APRV and AC+VG survived 24 h, compared with 62% of control pigs. APRV resulted in improved lung volume recruitment compared with AC+VG based on radiographs, lower Pco2 levels (44 ± 2.9 vs. 53 ± 2.7 mmHg, P = 0.009) and lower inspired oxygen fraction requirements (36 ± 6 vs. 44 ± 11%, P < 0.001), and higher oxygenation index (5.1 ± 1.5 vs. 2.9 ± 1.1, P = 0.001). There were no differences between APRV and AC+VG pigs for heart rate, ratio of wet to dry lung mass, proinflammatory cytokines, or histopathological markers of lung injury. Lung protective ventilation with APRV improved recruitment of alveoli of preterm lungs, enhanced development and maintenance of functional residual capacity without injury, and improved clinical outcomes relative to AC+VG. Long-term consequences of lung volume recruitment by using APRV should be evaluated.\"\n",

      "\"Impact of industrial activities on atmospheric volatile organic compounds in Sihwa-Banwol, the largest industrial area in South Korea.The impact of industrial activities on atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the Sihwa-Banwol complexes, i.e., the largest industrial area in Korea, was investigated. More than 60 VOCs were determined from 850 samples collected from four sites in and around the complexes through a 2-year monitoring campaign from 2005 to 2007. The VOCs of particular concern found in the area were benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, trichloroethylene, and formaldehyde, given their toxicity, concentration, and detection frequency. Toluene was the most abundant one. The VOC concentration rankings were consistent with their emission rankings. Most VOCs had higher concentrations at the industrial sites than at residential sites, indicating a significant impact of industrial emissions. The ambient levels of benzene and formaldehyde were additionally affected by vehicular emissions and secondary formation, respectively. Overall, the VOC levels increased in winter and at night, because of the local weather conditions. In contrast, the formaldehyde concentration increased in summer, owing to its secondary formation in the atmosphere. The ambient VOC levels in Sihwa-Banwol were higher than those in other parts of Korea. Additionally, the cumulative cancer risks posed by the toxic VOCs exceeded a tolerable risk level of 1 × 10-4 in not only the industrial areas but also the residential areas. The sum of the non-cancer risks in both areas significantly exceeded the threshold criterion of 1. The large amounts of aromatic compounds emitted from the industrial complexes are believed to play a crucial role in the elevated levels of surface ozone in the Seoul metropolitan area during the summer season. Therefore, comprehensive measures for controlling the VOC emissions in the Sihwa-Banwol area need to be prioritized to reduce the health risks for residents of not only this area but also the capital Seoul and its surrounding areas.\"\n",

      "\"Mouse Hepatitis Coronavirus RNA Replication Depends on GBF1-Mediated ARF1 ActivationCoronaviruses induce in infected cells the formation of double membrane vesicles, which are the sites of RNA replication. Not much is known about the formation of these vesicles, although recent observations indicate an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum in the formation of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication complexes (RCs). We now show that MHV replication is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA). Consistently, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF1, known to mimic the action of the drug, inhibited MHV infection profoundly. Immunofluorescence analysis and quantitative electron microscopy demonstrated that BFA did not block the formation of RCs per se, but rather reduced their number. MHV RNA replication was not sensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which are known to express the BFA-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Accordingly, individual knockdown of the Golgi-resident targets of BFA by transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) showed that GBF1, but not BIG1 or BIG2, was critically involved in MHV RNA replication. ARF1, the cellular effector of GBF1, also appeared to be involved in MHV replication, as siRNAs targeting this small GTPase inhibited MHV infection significantly. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation is required for efficient MHV RNA replication and reveal that the early secretory pathway and MHV replication complex formation are closely connected.\"\n",

      "\"Inter-sentence and Implicit Causality Extraction from Chinese CorpusAutomatically extracting causal relations from texts is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Most existing methods focus on extracting intra-sentence or explicit causality, while neglecting the causal relations that expressed implicitly or hidden in inter-sentences. In this paper, we propose Cascaded multi-Structure Neural Network (CSNN), a novel and unified model that extract inter-sentence or implicit causal relations from Chinese Corpus, without relying on external knowledge. The model employs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture important features as well as causal structural pattern. Self-attention mechanism is designed to mine semantic and relevant characteristics between different features. The output of CNN and self-attention structure are concatenated as higher-level phrase representations. Then Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer is employed to calculate the label of each word in inter-sentence or implicit causal relation sentences, which improves the performance of inter-sentence or implicit causality extraction. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results, improved on three datasets, when compared with other methods.\"\n",

      "\"Risk factors associated with mortality after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.OBJECTIVE We sought to identify the major risk factors associated with mortality in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery has become an established treatment for extreme obesity. Bariatric surgery mortality has steadily declined with current rates of less than 0.5%. However, significant variation in the mortality rates has been reported for specific patient cohorts and among bariatric centers. METHODS Clinical outcome data from 185,315 bariatric surgery patients from the Bariatric Outcome Longitudinal Database were reviewed. Of these, 157,559 patients had either documented 30 or more day follow-up data, including mortality. Multiple demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors were analyzed by univariate analysis for their association with 30-day mortality after gastric bypass. Variables found to be significant were entered into a multiple logistic regression model to identify factors independently associated with 30-day mortality. On the basis of these results, a RYGB mortality risk score was developed. RESULTS The overall 30-day mortality rate for the entire bariatric surgery cohort was 0.1%. Of the 81,751 RYGB patients, the mortality rate was 0.15%. Factors significantly associated with 30-day gastric bypass mortality included increasing body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), increasing age (P<0.005), male gender (P<0.001), pulmonary hypertension (P<0.0001), congestive heart failure (P=0.0008), and liver disease (P=0.038). When the RYGB risk score was applied, a significant trend (P<0.0001) between increasing risk score and mortality rate is found. CONCLUSIONS Increasing BMI, increasing age, male gender, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, and liver disease are risk factors for 30-day mortality after RYGB. The RYGB risk score can be used to determine patients at greater risk for mortality after RYGB surgery.\"\n",

      "\"Genus Psoralea: A review of the traditional and modern uses, phytochemistry and pharmacologyAbstract Ethnopharmacological relevance The genus Psoralea (Fabaceae) harbours 105 accepted species that are extensively used by local peoples and medicinal practitioners of China, India, and other countries for treatment of tooth decay, psoriasis, leucoderma, leprosy, kidney problems, tuberculosis, indigestion, constipation and impotence. Presently, pharmacological research reports are available on only few species namely Bituminaria bituminosa (Syn: P. bituminosa), P. canescens, P. corylifolia, P. esculenta, P. plicata and P. glandulosa which are valued for their chemical constituents and traditional uses. Aim of the review This review article provides explicit information on traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities of selected Psoralea species. The possible trends and perspectives for future research on these plants are also discussed. Materials and methods An extensive and systematic review of the extant literature was carried out, and the data under various sections were identified using a computerized bibliographic search via the PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE, EMBASE, INMEDPLAN, NATTS as well as several websites. Key findings A total of 291 bioactive compounds from 06 species of genus Psoralea have been isolated and characterized. However, P. bituminosa alone possess nearly 150 compounds. These bioactive compounds belong to different chemical classes, including flavonoids, coumarins, furanocoumarins, chalcones, quinines, terpenoids and some others due to which these species exhibit significant anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-helmintic, anti-diabetic, diuretic, hepatoprotective, anti-cancer and anti-tumor activities. P. corylifolia L. (Babchi), a Chinese traditional medicinal plant has been used in traditional medicine for many decades for its healing properties against numerous skin diseases such as leprosy, psoriasis and leucoderma. Conclusions The in vitro studies and in vivo models have provided a simple bio-scientific justification for various ethnopharmacological uses of Psoralea species. From the toxicological perspective, the root, leaf, and seed extracts and their preparations have been proven to be safe when consumed in the recommended doses. But, meticulous studies on the pharmaceutical standardization, mode of action of the active constituents, and sustainable conservation of Psoralea species are needed, to meet the growing demands of the pharmaceutical industries, and to fully exploit their preventive and therapeutic potentials.\"\n",

Since the diversity and size of the memory CD8+ T cell population increase with age, we questioned whether IM was mediated by the reactivation of memory CD8+ T cells specific to previously encountered pathogens but cross-reactive with EBV. Of 8 HLA-A2+ IM patients, 5 had activated T cells specific to another common virus, as evidenced by a significantly higher number of peripheral blood influenza A virus M1(58-66)-specific T cells compared with healthy immune donors. Two patients with an augmented M1 response had tetramer-defined cross-reactive cells recognizing influenza M1 and EBV-BMLF1(280-288), which accounted for up to one-third of their BMLF1-specific population and likely contributed to a skewed M1-specific T cell receptor repertoire. These epitopes, with only 33% sequence similarity, mediated differential effects on the function of the cross-reactive T cells, which may contribute to alterations in disease outcome. EBV could potentially encode an extensive pool of T cell epitopes that activate other cross-reactive memory T cells. Our results support the concept that cross-reactive memory CD8+ T cells activated by EBV contribute to the characteristic lymphoproliferation of IM.\"\n",

      "\"COVID-19 and immunosuppression: a review of current clinical experiences and implications for ophthalmology patients taking immunosuppressive drugsThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This is the third and largest coronavirus outbreak since the new millennium after SARS in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. Over 3 million people have been infected and the COVID-19 has caused more than 217 000 deaths. A concern exists regarding the vulnerability of patients who have been treated with immunosuppressive drugs prior or during this pandemic. Would they be more susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 and how would their clinical course be altered by their immunosuppressed state? This is a question the wider medical fraternity-including ophthalmologists, rheumatologists, gastroenterologist and transplant physicians among others-must answer. The evidence from the SARS and MERS outbreak offer some degree of confidence that immunosuppression is largely safe in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary clinical experiences based on case reports, small series and observational studies show the morbidity and mortality rates in immunosuppressed patients may not differ largely from the general population. Overwhelmingly, current best practice guidelines worldwide recommended the continuation of immunosuppression treatment in patients who require them except for perhaps high-dose corticosteroid therapy and in patients with associated risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.\"\n",

      "\"Three distinct suppressors of RNA silencing encoded by a 20-kb viral RNA genome.Viral infection in both plant and invertebrate hosts requires a virus-encoded function to block the RNA silencing antiviral defense. Here, we report the identification and characterization of three distinct suppressors of RNA silencing encoded by the approximately 20-kb plus-strand RNA genome of citrus tristeza virus (CTV). When introduced by genetic crosses into plants carrying a silencing transgene, both p20 and p23, but not coat protein (CP), restored expression of the transgene. Although none of the CTV proteins prevented DNA methylation of the transgene, export of the silencing signal (capable of mediating intercellular silencing spread) was detected only from the F(1) plants expressing p23 and not from the CP- or p20-expressing F(1) plants, demonstrating suppression of intercellular silencing by CP and p20 but not by p23. Thus, intracellular and intercellular silencing are each targeted by a CTV protein, whereas the third, p20, inhibits silencing at both levels. Notably, CP suppresses intercellular silencing without interfering with intracellular silencing. The novel property of CP suggests a mechanism distinct to p20 and all of the other viral suppressors known to interfere with intercellular silencing and that this class of viral suppressors may not be consistently identified by Agrobacterium coinfiltration because it also induces RNA silencing against the infiltrated suppressor transgene. Our analyses reveal a sophisticated viral counter-defense strategy that targets the silencing antiviral pathway at multiple steps and may be essential for protecting CTV with such a large RNA genome from antiviral silencing in the perennial tree host.\"\n",

      "\"A role for human leucocyte antigens in the susceptibility to SARS‐Cov‐2 infection observed in transplant patientsWe analysed data from 80 patients who tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA who had previously been HLA typed to support transplantation. Data were combined from two adjacent centres in Manchester and Leeds to achieve a sufficient number for early analysis. HLA frequencies observed were compared against two control populations: first, against published frequencies in a UK deceased donor population (n = 10,000) representing the target population of the virus, and second, using a cohort of individuals from the combined transplant waiting lists of both centres (n = 308), representing a comparator group of unaffected individuals of the same demographic. We report a significant HLA association with HLA‐ DQB1*06 (53% vs. 36%; p < .012; OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.94–3.22) and infection. A bias towards an increased representation of HLA‐A*26, HLA‐DRB1*15, HLA‐DRB1*10 and DRB1*11 was also noted but these were either only significant using the UK donor controls, or did not remain significant after correction for multiple tests. Likewise, HLA‐A*02, HLA‐B*44 and HLA‐C*05 may exert a protective effect, but these associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple tests. This is relevant information for the clinical management of patients in the setting of the current SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic and potentially in risk‐assessing staff interactions with infected patients.\"\n",

      "\"Central nervous system infections - a potential complication of systemic immunotherapy.PURPOSE OF REVIEW Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, characterized by demyelination and axonal damage. With the emergence of more efficient immune therapies, severe sometimes even fatal central nervous system infections were observed. This review will address the role of the systemic immune system in central nervous system immune surveillance and discuss implications for the development of novel immunotherapies in multiple sclerosis. RECENT FINDINGS In the last decade, a number of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents have been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, based on the results of double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease has prompted exploration of the therapeutic utility of new drugs that more potently disrupt the pathophysiological cascade of events that culminates in central nervous system tissue damage. One potential side-effect of these newer therapies is their interference with the control of central nervous system infections by the immune system. SUMMARY Any increase in potency of multiple sclerosis therapies could well interfere with protective immunosurveillance of the central nervous system. One possible outcome is an increased incidence of opportunistic infections. A heightened vigilance for central nervous system infections in the setting of immunosuppression is necessary to prevent serious side-effects in the future.\"\n",

The study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ERAS in single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (SIDG). MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 90 patients who received laparoscopic gastric cancer resection were divided into 3 groups: group A (n=30), underwent traditional multiport laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with conventional perioperative management; group B (n=30) underwent traditional multiport laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with ERAS concept; and group C (n=30), underwent SIDG with ERAS concept. Clinical data and gut function were assessed in 3 groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in terms of postoperative complication, number of resected lymph nodes and blood loss among 3 groups. However, operation time was longer (P=0.003) and treatment cost was higher (P<0.001) in group C than that in group A and B. Group C had faster recovery of bowel function (P<0.001), shorter postoperative hospital stay (P=0.002), and less postoperative complication (P=0.044) than those in group A. There were no significant differences in terms of recovery of bowel function and postoperative hospital stay between group C and B (all P>0.05). The white blood cell counts were lower than group A and B (all P<0.05) and C-reactive protein in group C were lower than group A (P<0.05) and B (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that SIDG with ERAS may be a feasible and safe procedure for early gastric cancer because it provides a favorable cosmetic result while not compromising postoperative complications, number of resected lymph nodes, and blood loss.\"\n",

      "\"Effect of informed consent on patient characteristics in a stroke thrombolysis trial.OBJECTIVE To determine whether the manner of consent, i.e., informed consent by patients themselves or informed consent by proxy, affects clinical characteristics of samples of acute stroke patients enrolled in clinical trials. METHODS We analyzed the manner of obtaining informed consent in the first 1,005 patients from WAKE-UP, an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of MRI-based thrombolysis in stroke patients with unknown time of symptom onset running in 6 European countries. Patients providing informed consent by themselves were compared with patients enrolled by proxy consent. Baseline clinical measures were compared between groups. RESULTS In 359 (35.7%) patients, informed consent was by proxy. Patients with proxy consent were older (median 71 vs 66 years, p < 0.0001) and had a higher frequency of arterial hypertension (58.2% vs 43.4%, p < 0.0001). They showed higher scores on the NIH Stroke Scale (median 11 vs 5, p < 0.0001) and more frequently aphasia (73.7% vs 20.0%, p < 0.0001). The rate of proxy consent varied among countries (p < 0.0001), ranging from 77.1% in Spain to 1.2% in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS Patients recruited by proxy consent were older, had more severe strokes, and had higher prevalence of aphasia than those with capacity to give personal consent.

      "\"SR-rich motif plays a pivotal role in recombinant SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein multimerization.The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is reported to function in encapsidating the viral genomic RNA into helical nucleocapsid, and its self-association is believed to be vital in coating the viral genomic RNA. Characterization of SARS-CoV N multimerization may thereby help us better understand the coronavirus assembly. In the current work, using the yeast two-hybrid technique, an unexpected interaction between residues 1-210 and 211-290 (central region) of the SARS-CoV N protein was detected, and SPR results further revealed that the SR-rich motif (amino acids 183-197) of SARS-CoV N protein is responsible for such an interaction. Chemical cross-linking and gel-filtration analyses indicated that the residues 283-422 of the SARS-CoV N protein have multimeric ability, although the full-length N protein is prone to exist predominantly as dimers. In addition, the multimeric ability of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein could be weakened by the SR-rich motif interaction with the central region (amino acids 211-290).

      "\"The NS5A protein of the hepatitis C virus genotype 1a is cleaved by caspases to produce C-terminal-truncated forms of the protein that reside mainly in the cytosol.The nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a multifunctional protein that is implicated in viral replication and pathogenesis. We report here that NS5A of HCV-1a is cleaved at multiple sites by caspase proteases in transfected cells. Two cleavage sites at positions Asp154 and 248DXXD251 were mapped. Cleavage at Asp154 has been previously recognized as one of the caspase cleavage sites for the NS5A protein of HCV genotype 1b (1, 2) and results in the production of a 17-kDa fragment. The sequence 248DXXD251 is a novel caspase recognition motif for NS5A and is responsible for the production of a 31-kDa fragment. Furthermore, we show that Arg217 is implicated in the production of the previously described 24-kDa product, whose accumulation is affected by both calpain and caspase inhibitors. We also showed that caspase-mediated cleavage occurs in the absence of exogenous proapoptotic stimuli and is not related to the accumulation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, our data indicate that NS5A is targeted by at least two different caspases and suggest that caspase 6 is implicated in the production of the 17-kDa fragment. Most importantly, we report that, all the detectable NS5A fragments following caspase-mediated cleavage are C-terminal-truncated forms of NS5A and are mainly localized in the cytosol. Thus, in sharp contrast to the current view we found no evidence supporting a role for caspase-mediated cleavage in the transport of the NS5A protein to the nucleus, which could lead to transcriptional activation.\"\n",

      "\"Recovery rate and factors associated with smell and taste disruption in patients with coronavirus disease 2019PURPOSE: To determine the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory disruptions in COVID-19 patients, their association with demographic and clinical features and prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This observational cohort study involved consecutively diagnosed COVID-19 patients tested between March the 3rd 2020 and March the 24th 2020, in a geographically defined cohort area. All COVID-19 patients were evaluated in a University Hospital. The primary outcome of interest is the prevalence of smell and taste alterations, factors associated and recovery rate. Univariate and multivariate analysis by logistic regression was performed to detect factors associated to these symptoms. RESULTS: 151 patients were included and 99 (65.3%) reported olfactory or gustatory symptoms. Olfactory dysfunction was reported by 75 patients (49.7%). Isolated anosmia was found in 2 patients (1.3%). Gustatory dysfunction was reported by 91 patients (60.3%). Factors associated with higher prevalence of smell dysfunction included age, sex, and comorbidities. The time to smell disruption development was significantly shorter in mild to moderate patients than in severe patients (p = 0.043). In 85.3% of patients with smell disruption, the symptom had been resolved in the first 2 months. 14.7% of patients remained symptomatic after 3 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was common in COVID-19 patients. Smell disruption has high recovery rate and was associated with age, sex, and clinical severity. It may be beneficial to investigate the appearance of taste and/or smell disruptions in individual patients, with respect to diagnosis and prognosis.\"\n",

      "\"Suitability and Sufficiency of Telehealth Clinician-Observed, Participant-Collected Samples for SARS-CoV-2 Testing: The iCollect Cohort Pilot StudyBACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic calls for expanded opportunities for testing, including novel testing strategies such as home-collected specimens. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand whether oropharyngeal swab (OPS), saliva, and dried blood spot (DBS) specimens collected by participants at home and mailed to a laboratory were sufficient for use in diagnostic and serology tests of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Eligible participants consented online and were mailed a participant-collection kit to support collection of three specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing: saliva, OPS, and DBS. Participants performed the specimen collection procedures during a telehealth video appointment while clinical observers watched and documented the suitability of the collection. The biological sufficiency of the specimens for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction and serology testing was assessed by laboratorians using visual inspection and quantification of the nucleic acid contents of the samples by ribonuclease P (RNase P) measurements. RESULTS: Of the enrolled participants,153/159 (96.2%) returned their kits, which were included in this analysis. All these participants attended their video appointments. Clinical observers assessed that of the samples collected, 147/153 (96.1%) of the saliva samples, 146/151 (96.7%) of the oropharyngeal samples, and 135/145 (93.1%) of the DBS samples were of sufficient quality for submission for laboratory testing; 100% of the OPS samples and 98% of the saliva samples had cycle threshold values for RNase P <30, indicating that the samples contained sufficient nucleic acid for RNA-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data indicate that most participant-collected OPS, saliva, and DBS specimens are suitable and sufficient for testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serology. Clinical observers rated the collection of specimens as suitable for testing, and visual and quantitative laboratory assessment indicated that the specimens were biologically sufficient. These data support the utility of participant-collected and mailed-in specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/19054\"\n",

      "\"Role of lipids in virus replication.Viruses intricately interact with and modulate cellular membranes at several stages of their replication, but much less is known about the role of viral lipids compared to proteins and nucleic acids. All animal viruses have to cross membranes for cell entry and exit, which occurs by membrane fusion (in enveloped viruses), by transient local disruption of membrane integrity, or by cell lysis. Furthermore, many viruses interact with cellular membrane compartments during their replication and often induce cytoplasmic membrane structures, in which genome replication and assembly occurs. Recent studies revealed details of membrane interaction, membrane bending, fission, and fusion for a number of viruses and unraveled the lipid composition of raft-dependent and -independent viruses. Alterations of membrane lipid composition can block viral release and entry, and certain lipids act as fusion inhibitors, suggesting a potential as antiviral drugs. Here, we review viral interactions with cellular membranes important for virus entry, cytoplasmic genome replication, and virus egress.\"\n",

      "\"Respiratory viral infections in a cohort of children during the first year of life and their role in the development of wheezing()INTRODUCTION: It is known that infants with viral respiratory infections severe enough to require hospital admission have a high risk of developing recurrent wheezing. Few data have been published on unselected populations. The main aim of this study was to analyse symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections during the first year of life in a cohort of infants, recruited at birth, and the development of recurrent wheezing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 302 newborns were recruited. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken when the patients had a respiratory infection, as well as in the visits for vaccination at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. RT-nested PCR assays were performed to detect 16 viruses. RESULTS: A total of 1293 samples were analysed (1005 healthy controls and 288 respiratory infections). Samples taken during routine check-ups were positive in 30.8% of cases, while those with respiratory infection were positive in 77.8%, P < .001 (OR: 3, 95% CI: 2.4–3.8). A total of 239 (79%) infants had at least 1 positive respiratory viral infection detected. The most frequent virus (71%) was rhinovirus (RV). Recurrent wheezing was found in 27 (11%) children during their first year of life (1.2 episodes, SD 2.9). Recurrent wheezing was present in 58.3% of patients admitted to hospital during their first viral infection, vs. 8.6% of infants when the first infection was mild or who had asymptomatic viral detection, P < .001 (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.05–4.5). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, severe respiratory infections leading to hospitalisation in the first months of life are risk factors for developing wheezing, but not in the case of mild RV infections.\"\n",

      "\"Exploring challenges of health system preparedness for communicable diseases in Arbaeen mass gathering: a qualitative studyBackground: Infectious diseases are common problems in mass gatherings, especially when there is a lack of health system preparedness. Since Iran is one of the most important countries on the walking path of Arbaeen and has a vital role in providing health services to pilgrims, the experiences of health challenges by participants is of key importance. The aim of this study is to explore stakeholders’ experiences on the health system's preparedness and challenges, and to provide suggestions for preventing infectious diseases during the Arbaeen mass gathering. Methods: A qualitative research method was used with a conventional content analysis approach. The number of participants was 17, including 13 executive managers and 4 health policymakers who entered the study among participants. Semi-structured interviews were used to generate the data. Interviews were analyzed by means of content analysis after face-to-face interviews. Results: Data analysis resulted in the extraction of four main themes and 11 sub-themes. Health infrastructure defects in Iraq has three sub-themes (health abandonment in Iraq, the weaknesses in health culture and problems related to the health system); poor control of the causative factors of infectious diseases has three sub-themes (the underlying factors of the prevalence of contagious diseases, health system response to communicable diseases and ignoring the risks of the Arbaeen ceremony); the low perception of risk in pilgrims has three sub-themes (lack of awareness in pilgrims, fatalism in pilgrims and unhygienic belief in pilgrims); and the ineffectiveness of health education has two sub-themes (training shortage in the targeted group and educational content problems) that shows participant’s experiences of the health system's challenges for coping with infectious diseases during the Arbaeen ceremony. Conclusion: Pilgrim-based training, planning and controlling other challenges may change these threats to opportunities and improve the health of participants of the mass gathering of Arbaeen in the region.\"\n",

Here, we have studied the ability of heparin to inhibit homophilic interactions of RAGE in living cells and studied how heparin related structures interfere with RAGE–ligand interactions. Methods: Homophilic interactions of RAGE were studied with bead aggregation and living cell protein-fragment complementation assays. Ligand binding was analyzed with microwell binding and chromatographic assays. Cell surface advanced glycation end product binding to RAGE was studied using PC3 cell adhesion assay. Results: Homophilic binding of RAGE was mediated by V(1)- and modulated by C(2)-domain in bead aggregation assay. Dimerisation of RAGE on the living cell surface was inhibited by heparin. Sulphated K5 carbohydrate fragments inhibited RAGE binding to amyloid β-peptide and HMGB1. The inhibition was dependent on the level of sulfation and the length of the carbohydrate backbone. α-d-Glucopyranosiduronic acid (glycyrrhizin) inhibited RAGE binding to advanced glycation end products in PC3 cell adhesion and protein binding assays. Further, glycyrrhizin inhibited HMGB1 and HMGB1 A-box binding to heparin. Conclusions: Our results show that K5 polysaccharides and glycyrrhizin are promising candidates for RAGE targeting drug development.\"\n",

      "\"Stimulated innate resistance of lung epithelium protects mice broadly against bacteria and fungi.Pneumonia is a serious problem worldwide. We recently demonstrated that innate defense mechanisms of the lung are highly inducible against pneumococcal pneumonia. To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and the fungal pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus. Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line. Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kappaB, type I and II IFN, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways. Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection. Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly up-regulated. Taken together, stimulated innate resistance appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens. Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection.\"\n",

Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources – Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive – to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geolocalized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.\"\n",

      "\"Microbiological, pathological and histological findings in four Danish pig herds affected by a new neonatal diarrhoea syndromeBACKGROUND: Neonatal diarrhoea is a frequent clinical condition in commercial swine herds, previously regarded to be uncomplicated to treat. However, since 2008 it seems that a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices has emerged. Routine laboratory examinations have not detected any pathogen related to this syndrome. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic findings associated with these outbreaks and if possible propose a preliminary piglet-level case-definition on syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea syndrome (NNPDS). RESULTS: Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea with no previously established laboratory conclusion and suspected to suffer from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome, were selected. Within these herds, 51 diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were necropsied and subjected to histological and microbiological examination. Faeces were non-haemorrhagic. Neither enterotoxigenic E. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis nor Strongyloides ransomi were associated with diarrhoea in the investigated outbreaks. Macroscopically, the diarrhoeic piglets were characterized by filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal changes. The predominant histological lesions were villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum. Epithelial lesions in colon were seen in one third of the case piglets. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that a new neonatal porcine diarrhoea was present in the investigated herds, since no known pathogen(s) or management factors could explain the diarrhoeal outbreaks. Based on the findings in the four herds the following case-definition of NNPDS was suggested: Non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first week of life, without detection of known infectious pathogens, characterized by milk-filled stomachs and flaccid intestines at necropsy.\"\n",

METHOD Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (NPA) from 349 patients(1 from each) and 130 cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) specimens were collected from children who were admitted to the PICU of Second Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College. Additional 87 NPA specimens were collected from healthy children for routine examination on the physical examination center, and the clinical data were collected. Multiplex PCR was applied to detect 16 kinds of viruses from NPA and CSF. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was applied to detect 13 viruses from CSF and to analyze the clinical data of positive cases. RESULT There were 209 samples (59.9%) of the 349 NPA specimens were positive for viruses, which included 117 cases positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), 60 for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 20 for influenza virus A (Inf A), 10 for adenovirus (ADV), 6 for parainfluenza virus type 3(PIV-3), 6 for human Boca virus (HBoV), 5 for influenza virus C(Inf C), 4 for parainfluenza virus type 4(PIV-4), 4 for human coronavirus-HKU1/OC43, 3 for influenza virus B (Inf B), 3 for WU Polyomavirus (WUPyV), 2 parainfluenza virus type 1(PIV-1), 2 human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and 1 human coronavirus-NL63/229E. But none from 87 healthy controls were positive for any respiratory virus. Among the 130 CSF specimens, in 58 cases the diagnosis was viral encephalitis. There were 22 samples (37.9%) among the 58 CSF specimens positive for viruses, which included 14 enterovirus (EV), 3 human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), 2 mumps virus, 1 coxsackie virus A16 (Cox-A16), 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV) and 1 human rhinovirus (HRV). The total positive rate was 63.3% (221/349) . Co-infection by at least 2 viral pathogens under study was observed in 45 of the 349 patients (12.9% of the total number of cases, 20.4% of the positives cases). The commonest pathogens in co-infected samples were WUPyV (100%) and HMPV(100%). The positive rate of virus peaked in the first 6 months of life, the rate in boys were higher than in girls and the peak season was summer. The numbers of none serious cases in the virus positive group were less than those in the virus negative group while the numbers of extremely serious cases in the virus positive group were higher than in the virus negative group. CONCLUSION Viral pathogen is a major cause of infectious disease in pediatric critical illnesses and virus infection may lead to severe illness.\"\n",

      "\"Epidemiological characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis in Shandong, China, 2005–2017: A retrospective studyThis study aimed to analyze the epidemiology of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and gained insight into the future TB control plan in China. We extracted epidemiological, clinical, and geographic data from TB prevention and control institutions in 6 cities of Shandong province, China, during 2005 to 2017. Among 224,480 diagnosed PTB, rural residents accounted for 93%, smear-positive PTB 52%, and new cases 92%. The incidence rate of overall PTB declined from 40.8 to 26.25 per 100,000 during 2005 to 2017. Except smear-negative PTB (7.57–19.87 per 100,000), the incidence of smear-positive PTB and all that stratified by age, sex, and treatment history decreased. With 80% reduction, the incidence of smear-positive PTB (6.38 per 100,000) and relapse cases (1.01 per 100,000) were already very low in 2017. With persistent efforts to combat TB, the disease burden had shifted from smear-positive PTB to smear-negative PTB. While new cases need continuous attention, further reducing the incidence of smear-negative PTB and elderly patients may have a greater impact on future TB control.\"\n",

      "\"Higher levels of IL‐6 early after tocilizumab distinguish survivors from non‐survivors in COVID‐19 pneumonia: a possible indication for deeper targeting IL‐6INTRODUCTION: The most serious COVID‐19 deriving from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes cytokine release storm and it is associated with worse outcomes. In COVID‐19 patients, Interleukin (IL)‐6 levels are significantly elevated. Blocking IL‐6 preliminary resulted in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. It is unknown which patients could require higher doses of tocilizumab to get out of the cytokine storm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty‐four patients affected by COVID‐19 pneumonia were included. All the patients underwent tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously and were tested for serum IL‐6 24‐48 hours before and 12‐48 hours after tocilizumab infusion. Comparisons between survivors and non‐survivors were performed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were discharged, while six patients died, with no clinical or laboratory differences between the two groups at baseline. IL‐6 was not different at baseline (p=0.41), while 24‐48h post‐tocilizumab IL‐6 serum levels were significantly higher in non‐survivors than in survivors [2398.5 (430.5‐9372) pg/mL vs 290.5 (58.5‐1305.5) pg/mL, p=0.022)]. Serum IL‐6 post‐tocilizumab showed a good predictive ability to discriminate survivors from non‐survivors (AUC 0.815 95%CI 0.63‐0.99, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Repeated measurement of serum level of IL‐6 early after tocilizumab may distinguish non‐survivors from survivors and support the choice of deeper targeting IL‐6 in COVID‐19 pneumonia.

      "\"Predictors for compliance of standard precautions among nursing studentsBACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the frequency of standard precautions (SPs) compliance and the factors affecting the compliance among nursing students (NSs). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study guided by the health belief model was conducted in 2009. The study questionnaire is valid (content validity index, 0.81) and reliable (Cronbach α range, 0.65-0.94). RESULTS: There were 678 questionnaires analyzed, with a response rate of 68.9%. The mean frequency score of SPs compliance was 4.38 ± 0.40 out of 5. Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F(1,593) = 3.72; P < .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff. CONCLUSION: Although the SPs compliance among NSs was high, the compliance varied by year of study and was affected by the nursing staff. Furthermore, SPs compliance among NSs can be enhanced by increasing SPs knowledge, providing more SPs training, promoting management support, reducing identified SPs barriers, and improving nursing staff compliance to SPs.\"\n",

The trend is to reduce the number of incisions, and thus single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) and natural orifice endoscopic surgery (NOTES) are becoming popular. There is a paucity of studies pertaining to cosmetic outcome after SILC and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy in rural Indian population. In the present study, the cosmetic outcome of SILC versus conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) in rural Indian population was evaluated. Sixty patients with gallstone disease were randomly assigned to two groups. In group A (n = 30), CLC was performed, while group B (n = 30) was subjected to SILC. The cosmetic outcome was evaluated using a body image questionnaire on the 7th and 30th postoperative days. On the 7th postoperative day, the body image score for SILC was 6.23 ± 0.89 and for CLC, 8.26 ± 1.08 (p < 0.0001), while the cosmetic score for SILC was 19.56 ± 1.07 and for CLC, 15 ± 1.20 (p < 0.0001). On the 30th postoperative day, the body image score for SILC was 5.50 ± 0.68 and for CLC, 8 ± 1.31 (p < 0.0001), while the cosmetic score for SILC was 21.13 ± 0.57 and for CLC, 15.63 ± 1.06 (p < 0.0001), which favored SILC over CLC.

      "\"Cis-acting sequences may contribute to size variation in the surface glycoprotein of bovine immunodeficiency virus.Genetic recombination is an important mechanism of retrovirus variation and diversity. Size variation in the surface (SU) glycoprotein, characterized by duplication and insertion, has been observed during in vivo infection with several lentiviruses, including bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. These duplication/insertion events are thought to occur through a mechanism of template switching/strand transfer during reverse transcription. Studies of RNA recombination in a number of virus systems indicate that cis-acting sequences can modulate the frequency of template switching/strand transfer. The size variable region of EIAV and BIV SU glycoproteins was examined and an AU-rich region and regions of nucleotide sequence identity that may facilitate template switching/strand transfer were identified. An in vitro strand transfer assay using donor and acceptor templates derived from the size variable region in BIV env detected both precise and imprecise strand transfer products, in addition to full-length products. Sequence analysis of clones obtained from imprecise strand transfer products showed that 87.5% had crossover sites within 10 nt of the crossover site observed in vivo. Mutations in the donor template which altered either the AU-rich region or nucleotide sequence identity dramatically decreased the frequency of imprecise strand transfer. Together, these results suggest that cis-acting elements can modulate non-homologous recombination events during reverse transcription and may contribute to the genetic and biological diversity of lentiviruses in vivo.\"\n",

      "\"Endovascular Therapy versus Thrombolysis in Patients with Mild Strokes and Large Vessel Occlusions within the Anterior Circulation.Background In patients with large vessel occlusions, endovascular treatment (ET) has been shown to be superior to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in recent trials. However, it is currently unclear if patients with mild strokes also benefit from ET. Methods We compared the discharge rates of good outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] ≤2), very good outcome (mRS 0-1), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages (SICH), and infarct sizes in patients with mild strokes (admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤10) and distal intracranial carotid artery, M1, and M2 occlusions during two time periods. Results From 1/2008 to 10/2012 160 patients (mean age: 72 ± 12 years) were treated with IVT, and from 11/2012 to 11/2016 145 patients (mean age: 71 ± 13 years,) received ET with or without IVT. The clinical results were comparable between both treatment groups (59% after ET vs. 56% after IVT, p = 0.5 for an mRS 0-2) and (38% after ET vs. 32% after IVT, p = 0.3 for an mRS 0-1). In the subgroup of patients with an mRS ≤6, the early outcome did not differ significantly between ET and IVT either. The rates of SICH as well as the infarct sizes were not significantly different after ET compared with IVT. Conclusion Compared with IVT, the routine use of ET did not significantly improve the early clinical or radiological outcome in patients with mild strokes and anterior circulation large vessel occlusions. Further randomized trials are urgently needed to determine the role of ET in this cohort.\"\n",

Studies suggest that mortality due to COVID 19 is mainly attributed to the hyper inflammatory response leading to cytokine storm and ARDS in infected patients. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) analogs, AAL-R and RP-002, have earlier provided in-vivo protection from the pathophysiological response during H1N1 influenza infection and improved mortality. Recently, it was shown that the treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 analog, CYM5442, resulted in the significant dampening of the immune response upon H1N1 challenge in mice and improved survival of H1N1 infected mice in combination with an antiviral drug, oseltamivir.

      "\"A Knowledge Asset Management Implementation Framework for Information Systems Outsourcing ProjectsOrganisations are increasingly outsourcing information systems (IS) to external service providers. These IS outsourcing decisions are driven by multiple organisational factors such as outsource vendor expertise and knowledge, process performance improvement due to better IS, and enabling the organisation’s ability to focus on its core capabilities. In order to harnass such vendor knowledge to achieve business outcomes, the importance of a shared knowledge asset base, between the client organisation and outsource vendor, is emphasised. However, outcomes from IS outsourcing remain poor despite consideration of experience and research. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design and propose a knowledge asset management implementation framework that may be applied in IS outsourcing projects. The proposed framework was evaluated by an experienced programme director and its applicability was tested against a large scale IS outsourcing project. The purpose of such a framework is to enable organisations to manage and institutionalise knowledge assets that are created during the IS outsourcing project and to ensure that the organisation may gain the benefit from such knowledge assets as an outcome of the IS outsourcing arrangement.\"\n",

Colo205-bearing mice were divided into six treatment groups: (1) control, (2) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 250 mg/kg), (3) irinotecan (100 mg/kg), (4) oxaliplatin (30 mg/kg), (5) bevacizumab (5 mg/kg), and (6) panitumumab (6 mg/kg). (99m)Tc-(CO)₃ His-ann A5 was injected 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours posttreatment, and micro-single-photon emission computed tomography was performed. Immunostaining of caspase-3 (apoptosis), survivin (antiapoptosis), and LC3-II (autophagy marker) was also performed. Different dynamics of (99m)Tc-(CO)₃ His-ann A5 uptake were observed in this colorectal cancer xenograft model, in response to a single dose of three different chemotherapeutics (5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin). Bevacizumab-treated mice showed no increased uptake of the radiotracer, and a peak of (99m)Tc-(CO)₃ His-ann A5 uptake in panitumumab-treated mice was observed 24 hours posttreatment, as confirmed by caspase-3 immunostaining. For irinotecan-, oxaliplatin-, and bevacizumab-treated tumors, a significant correlation was established between the radiotracer uptake and caspase-3 immunostaining (r = .8, p < .05; r = .9, p < .001; r = .9, p < .001, respectively). For 5-FU- and panitumumab-treated mice, the correlation coefficients were r = .7 (p = .18) and r = .7 (p = .19), respectively. Optimal timing of annexin A5 imaging after the start of different treatments in the Colo205 model was determined.\"\n",

The algae extracts were prepared using three different methodologies to compare the activity of different groups of chemical composites obtained through these different methodologies. Four out of the six extracts inhibited nearly 100% of viral replication. The results demonstrated that the majority of the extracts (five out of six) possess virucidal activity and therefore have the ability to interact with the extracellular viral particles and prevent the infection. On the other hand, only two extracts (from Forno beach, obtained by maceration and maceration of the decoction) were able to interact with cell receptors, hindering the viral entry. Finally, only the extract of algae collected at Forno beach, obtained by maceration presented intracellular activity. To our knowledge, this is a pioneer study on antiviral activity of marine algae against HMPV. It is also the first on antiviral activity against HMPV ever done in Brazil. The study also shows the effect of different environment factors and different chemical procedures used to obtain the extract on its biological properties.\"\n",

      "\"Endovascular treatment of carotid blowout syndrome.BACKGROUND Carotid blowout syndrome (CBS) is a life-threatening complication of head and neck cancer and radiation therapy. Endovascular techniques have emerged as preferable alternatives to surgical ligation for treatment of CBS. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study periprocedural complications and outcomes of CBS patients treated with coil embolization and covered stents. METHODS A comprehensive literature search identified studies that reported outcomes of endovascular treatment of CBS published from 2000 to April 2016. Outcomes included technical success, postoperative rebleeding, survival time, and perioperative complications. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS Twenty-five noncomparative studies with 559 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Technical success rate was 100% in both coiling and covered stenting groups. Median survival time was 3 months (range, 0-96 months) for all CBS patients. Overall perioperative mortality was 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5%-17%). Postoperative rebleeding rate was 27% (95% CI, 19%-367%). Perioperative stroke and infection rates were 3% (95% CI, 1%-6%) and 1% (95% CI, 0%-5%), respectively. At last follow-up, 39% of patients were alive (95% CI, 29%-48%). CONCLUSIONS Coil embolization and stent grafts may both be safe treatment options for CBS with few perioperative complications and high rates of technical success, but prognosis after treatment remains poor. In general, noncomparative studies do not demonstrate differences between the two techniques with respect to periprocedural complications and patient outcomes.\"\n",

      "\"Robotic-assisted ventral and incisional hernia repair with hernia defect closure and intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) experience.BACKGROUND The most common technique described for robotic ventral hernia repair (RVHR) is intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM). With the evolution of robotics, advanced techniques including retro rectus mesh reinforcement, and component separation are being popularized. However, these procedures require more dissection, and longer operative times. In this study we reviewed our experience with robotic ventral/incisional hernia repair (RVHR) with hernia defect closure (HDC) and IPOM. METHODS Retrospective chart review and follow-up of 31 consecutive cases of ventral/incisional hernia treated between August 2011 and December 2018. Demographics, operative times, blood loss, length of stay (LOS), hernia size, location, and type, mesh size and type, recurrence, conversion to open ventral hernia repair (OVHR) and complications including bleeding, seroma formation and infection were analyzed. RESULTS Mean age was 63.9 years old, with median BMI of 31.24 kg/m2. Median hernia area was 17 cm2. Mean operating time was 142.61 min (SD 59.79). Mean LOS was 1.46 days (range 1-5), with 48% being outpatient, and overnight stay in 32% for pain control. Conversion was necessary in 12.9% cases. Complication rate was 3% for enterotomy. Recurrence was 14.81% after a mean follow-up of 26.96 months. There was significant association of recurrence with COPD history (P = 0.0215) and multiple hernia defects (P = 0.0376). CONCLUSION Our recurrence rate (14.81%) compares favorably to those reported in literature (16.7%) for LVHR with HDC and IPOM. Our experience also indicates that IPOM is associated with satisfactory outcomes, low conversion and complications rates, and short LOS.\"\n",

      "\"Favipiravir, an anti-influenza drug against life-threatening RNA virus infectionsAbstract Favipiravir has been developed as an anti-influenza drug and licensed as an anti-influenza drug in Japan. Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for 2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza, favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus, rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant viruses. Favipiravir alone maintains its therapeutic efficacy from the first to the last patient in an influenza pandemic or an epidemic lethal RNA virus infection. Favipiravir is expected to be an important therapeutic agent for severe influenza, the next pandemic influenza strain, and other severe RNA virus infections for which standard treatments are not available.\"\n",

Immunohistochemical analysis showed no PD-L1 expression. Whole-exon sequencing revealed a relatively high tumor mutation burden at 396. After the failure of three standard chemotherapy regimens, the patient was treated with nivolumab as fourth-line treatment. An obvious reduction in the lung metastases was obtained for more than 14 months.

Experiential apprentice-style training is traditionally recognised as an important aspect of obtaining competency. In March 2020 they were stood down from their general practice placements in the context of a national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Acute conversion of their general practice education from experiential clinical exposure to online and offsite learning was required. This paper describes the steps taken and the underlying theoretical foundations for our expediently developed online course. Our online learning programme has three online components, reflecting the domains of educational environment theory: asynchronous discussion forums; a symposium facilitating social interactions and teacher presence, and a portfolio facilitating personal goal aspects. The latter is underpinned by a multi-theories model of adult learning, built upon the scaffolding framework that supports our entire medical curriculum. Within this theory, we propose a five-stage model of learning. Learning from this experience contributes to the body of knowledge around online education, particularly in meeting the needs of a clinical attachment traditionally grounded in experiential learning. It is hoped that the mechanisms described here might be useful to other educators facing similar challenges.\"\n",

Observations were made on 44 dogs that had clinical signs of enteritis or had a recent history compatible with a clinical diagnosis of enteritis. Eight of the 44 dogs died. Gross and histopathologic examinations performed on these dogs revealed that the lesions were similar to those described for canine viral enteritis. Antigens that agglutinated rhesus macaque RBC were detected in feces from 4 of 20 dogs. Cytopathic effects were observed in canine A-72 cells after their inoculation with fecal suspensions from these 4 dogs and with a fecal suspension from another dog. Cell cultures inoculated with each of the suspensions produced antigens that agglutinated RBC. All hemagglutinating antigens were inhibited in the presence of feline panleukopenia virus antiserum. Using electron microscopy, parvovirus-like virions were observed in a fecal suspension from 2 dogs (1 dog that had antigen that agglutinated rhesus macaque RBC and 1 dog that was negative for feline panleukopenia virus). Canine parvovirus hemagglutination inhibition antibody was detected in sera from 33 of the 40 dogs examined, and canine coronavirus (CV) neutralizing antibody was found in 29 of 30 dogs.

This became the foundation of our practices in COVID-19. However, some adaptations were made to suit the current needs of the department, and technology has been employed for communication. This paper describes the preparation and response of nursing in Radiology Department in Singapore in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Protocols and measures taken during SARS and COVID-19 were described.Stringent infection control and prevention measures, detailed standard operating protocols for handling SARS and COVID-19 patients coming for radiological examinations and interventions, team segregation, safe distancing, efficient communication and rigorous staff surveillance are paramount to ensure patient and staff safety.Our SARS experience has shaped our preparations and response towards the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, there have been zero healthcare worker transmission in the department. The crisis has also enhanced the cohesiveness among staff due to the camaraderie and shared experience.The response and measures taken by the Radiology Department in a large acute care teaching hospital could be practiced in other similar healthcare settings.\"\n",

      "\"Association of chemosensory dysfunction and Covid‐19 in patients presenting with influenza‐like symptomsBACKGROUND: Rapid spread of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus and concern for viral transmission by ambulatory patients with minimal to no symptoms underline the importance of identifying early or subclinical symptoms of Covid‐19 infection. Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste. Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in Covid‐19 may help facilitate screening and early isolation of cases. METHODS: A single‐institution, cross‐sectional study evaluating patient‐reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet‐based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for Covid‐19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with Covid‐19 positivity. RESULTS: A total of 1480 patients with influenza‐like symptoms underwent Covid‐19 testing between March 3 through 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) Covid‐19‐positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) Covid‐19‐negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of Covid‐19‐positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of Covid‐19‐negative patients (p<0.001). Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with Covid‐19‐positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9, 95%CI:5.08‐23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2 95%CI:4.74‐22.1); whereas, sore throat was associated with Covid‐19‐negativity (aOR 0.23, 95%CI:0.11‐0.50). Of patients who reported Covid‐19‐associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness. CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory individuals with influenza‐like symptoms, chemosensory dysfunction was strongly associated with Covid‐19 infection and should be considered when screening symptoms. Most will recover chemosensory function within weeks paralleling resolution of other disease‐related symptoms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved\"\n",

      "\"Studies on Calf Diarrhoea in Mozambique: Prevalence of Bacterial PathogensThe prevalence of diarrhoea in calves was investigated in 8 dairy farms in Mozambique at 4 occasions during 2 consecutive years. A total of 1241 calves up to 6 months of age were reared in the farms, and 63 (5%) of them had signs of diarrhoea. Two farms had an overall higher prevalence (13% and 21%) of diarrhoea. Faecal samples were collected from all diarrhoeal calves (n = 63) and from 330 healthy calves and analysed for Salmonella species, Campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Salmonella spp. was isolated in only 2% of all calves. Campylobacter was isolated in 11% of all calves, irrespective of health condition, and was more frequent (25%) in one of the 2 diarrhoeal farms (p = 0.001). 80% of the isolates were identified as C. jejuni. No ETEC strains were detected among the 55 tested strains from diarrhoeal calves, but 22/55 (40%) strains from diarrhoeal calves and 14/88 (16%) strains from healthy calves carried the K99 adhesin (p = 0.001). 6,757 E. coli isolates were typed with a biochemical fingerprinting method (the PhenePlate™) giving the same E. coli diversity in healthy and diarrhoeal calves. Thus it was concluded: i) the overall prevalence of diarrhoea was low, but 2 farms had a higher prevalence that could be due to an outbreak situation, ii) Salmonella did not seem to be associated with diarrhoea, iii) Campylobacter jejuni was common at one of the 2 diarrhoeal farms and iv) ETEC strains were not found, but K99 antigen was more prevalent in E. coli strains from diarrhoeal calves than from healthy, as well as more prevalent in one diarrhoeal farm.\"\n",

      "\"Amantadine in treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection?Summary. Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) continues to be an important and growing challenge. As the response rate to FDA‐approved treatment improved over the past decade, we are facing increasing number of difficult‐to‐treat patients such as those who have failed prior anti‐viral therapy. The role of amantadine in the treatment of CHC remains unclear. Studies thus far have produced conflicting results, and type II error could not be excluded. This review summarized results published in the literature from 1997 to 2003, and reviewed the existing questions and controversies regarding the use of amantadine. Current literature suggests that amantadine is ineffective as monotherapy. Amantadine increased the sustained virologic response of certain treatment naïve patients when used in combination with interferon, and may be effective as an adjunct to interferon‐based combination therapy in some patients who have failed or relapsed on prior therapy. Factors such as small sample size, patient characteristics, and differences in treatment protocols including amantadine preparation and duration of therapy might explain the conflicting observations of various studies. Further investigations are needed to define optimal dosing and formulation of amantadine, and its appropriate role in management of CHC infection.\"\n",

      "\"Development of real‐time fluorescent reverse transcription loop‐mediated isothermal amplification assays for rhinovirus detectionHuman rhinoviruses (RVs) belong to the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae, and are classified into RV‐A, ‐B, and ‐C species. Two assays were developed to detect RVs by a real‐time fluorescent reverse transcription loop‐mediated isothermal amplification method: one was designed based on the 5′‐untranslated regions (UTRs) of RV‐A and ‐B, and the other was designed based on the 5′‐UTR of RV‐C. The competence of both assays for the diagnosis of RV infection was tested using isolated viruses and compared with real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays on clinical specimens. Neither assay demonstrated cross‐reactivity with other tested enteroviruses, and they detected 19 out of 21 tested RV‐As and seven out of eight tested RV‐Cs. The specificity of the assays was 100% for the detection of RVs and their sensitivity for RV‐A and RV‐C was 86.3% and 77.3%, respectively, on clinical specimens by the combined use of both assays. Considering that both developed assays were highly specific and detected the majority of recently circulating RVs, they are helpful for the diagnosis of RV infection. Consequently, the results generated by these assays will enhance the surveillance of respiratory illness and the study of the roles of RVs associated with clinical features and disease severity.\"\n",

All patients were enrolled from the Department of Dermatology between February 12 and May 8, 2020, the duration of 4 weeks before COVID-19 and 8 weeks after were analyzed in three parts consisting of 4 weeks. Data obtained from the database such as age, gender, diagnoses were anonymized. Repeated applications with the same diagnosis in 10 days after the first presentation were ignored. Compared to the pre-outbreak, there was a 3.5-fold decrease in dermatology applications in the first month after COVID-19 and an 8.8-fold in the second month. We found a significant increase in the frequency of diagnoses such as generalized pruritus, pityriasis rosea, alopecia areata, bacterial skin/mucosa diseases, and zona zoster after COVID-19. The frequency declined in diseases such as verruca vulgaris, hyperpigmentation, skin tag, melanocytic nevus, and seborrheic keratosis/solar lentigo. It has been found that the frequencies of most diseases, including acne (â25% of patients), did not change.

      "\"A 3D system for culturing human articular chondrocytes in synovial fluid.Cartilage destruction is a central pathological feature of osteoarthritis, a leading cause of disability in the US. Cartilage in the adult does not regenerate very efficiently in vivo; and as a result, osteoarthritis leads to irreversible cartilage loss and is accompanied by chronic pain and immobility (1,2). Cartilage tissue engineering offers promising potential to regenerate and restore tissue function. This technology typically involves seeding chondrocytes into natural or synthetic scaffolds and culturing the resulting 3D construct in a balanced medium over a period of time with a goal of engineering a biochemically and biomechanically mature tissue that can be transplanted into a defect site in vivo (3-6). Achieving an optimal condition for chondrocyte growth and matrix deposition is essential for the success of cartilage tissue engineering. In the native joint cavity, cartilage at the articular surface of the bone is bathed in synovial fluid. This clear and viscous fluid provides nutrients to the avascular articular cartilage and contains growth factors, cytokines and enzymes that are important for chondrocyte metabolism (7,8). Furthermore, synovial fluid facilitates low-friction movement between cartilaginous surfaces mainly through secreting two key components, hyaluronan and lubricin (9 10). In contrast, tissue engineered cartilage is most often cultured in artificial media. While these media are likely able to provide more defined conditions for studying chondrocyte metabolism, synovial fluid most accurately reflects the natural environment of which articular chondrocytes reside in. Indeed, synovial fluid has the advantage of being easy to obtain and store, and can often be regularly replenished by the body. Several groups have supplemented the culture medium with synovial fluid in growing human, bovine, rabbit and dog chondrocytes, but mostly used only low levels of synovial fluid (below 20%) (11-25). While chicken, horse and human chondrocytes have been cultured in the medium with higher percentage of synovial fluid, these culture systems were two-dimensional (26-28). Here we present our method of culturing human articular chondrocytes in a 3D system with a high percentage of synovial fluid (up to 100%) over a period of 21 days. In doing so, we overcame a major hurdle presented by the high viscosity of the synovial fluid. This system provides the possibility of studying human chondrocytes in synovial fluid in a 3D setting, which can be further combined with two other important factors (oxygen tension and mechanical loading) (29,30) that constitute the natural environment for cartilage to mimic the natural milieu for cartilage growth. Furthermore, This system may also be used for assaying synovial fluid activity on chondrocytes and provide a platform for developing cartilage regeneration technologies and therapeutic options for arthritis.\"\n",

      "\"A Descriptive Study of Coronavirus Disease 2019–Related Experiences and Perspectives of a National Sample of College Students in Spring 2020PURPOSE: This is one of the first surveys of a USA-wide sample of full-time college students about their coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–related experiences in spring 2020. METHODS: We surveyed 725 full-time college students aged 18–22 years recruited via Instagram promotions on April 25–30, 2020. We inquired about their COVID-19–related experiences and perspectives, documented opportunities for transmission, and assessed COVID-19's perceived impacts to date. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of participants experienced any COVID-19–related symptoms from February to April 2020, but less than 5% of them got tested, and only 46% stayed home exclusively while experiencing symptoms. Almost all (95%) had sheltered in place/stayed primarily at home by late April 2020; 53% started sheltering in place before any state had an official stay-at-home order, and more than one-third started sheltering before any metropolitan area had an order. Participants were more stressed about COVID-19's health implications for their family and for American society than for themselves. Participants were open to continuing the restrictions in place in late April 2020 for an extended period of time to reduce pandemic spread. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial opportunity for improved public health responses to COVID-19 among college students, including for testing and contact tracing. In addition, because most participants restricted their behaviors before official stay-at-home orders went into effect, they may continue to restrict movement after stay-at-home orders are lifted, including when colleges reopen for in-person activities, if they decide it is not yet prudent to circulate freely. The public health, economic, and educational implications of COVID-19 are continuing to unfold; future studies must continue to monitor college student experiences and perspectives.\"\n",

      "\"Food systems for resilient futuresIn this time of the pandemic, nothing is as it used to be. This change creates space for new narratives towards resilience. The resilience perspective implies preparing for shocks as well as various futures that might evolve. Thus, more sustainable food systems cannot only be built to be pandemic proof. This preparation can be facilitated by co-designing contrasting future narratives, identifying means for developing capacity to adapt to those futures and developing tools to enhance that capacity, such as demonstrated here. The capacity of food systems to adapt and transform is enhanced by dialogue, transparency and collective learning in food value chains and networks, sovereignty over resources, and built-in diversity in response to change. In market-led global food chains, supplier-buyer diversity is important, while in public-led regions with some market protection, farm and crop diversity might matter more in response to variability in weather, price and policies. During, for example, an international conflict, or the time of a pandemic, diverse food sourcing from local producer-consumer cooperatives to community-supported and urban agriculture could secure food for citizens. Assessments of critical diversity in response to shocks and volatility can help actors to tailor effective diversity to manage resilience while avoiding the long-feared trade-off between diversity and resource-use efficiency. The interdependence of humanity deserves attention, as food systems are only as resilient as their weakest actor. A truly resilient global food system implies not only preparedness for coming shocks and changes but also a foundation that makes shocks less probable and critical.\"\n",

      "\"Social media and smartphone app use predicts maintenance of physical activity during Covid-19 enforced isolation in psychiatric outpatientsPublic health professionals have raised concerns that the social and physical distancing measures implemented in response to the Covid-19 pandemic may negatively impact health in other areas, via both decreased physical activity and increased social isolation. Here, we investigated whether increased engagement with digital social tools may help mitigate effects of enforced isolation on physical activity and mood, in a naturalistic study of at-risk individuals. Passively sensed smartphone app use and actigraphy data, collected from a sample of psychiatric outpatients both before and during imposition of strict lockdown conditions (N=163), were analysed using Gaussian graphical models: a form of network analysis which gives insight into the predictive relationships between measures across timepoints. Within-individuals, we found evidence of a positive predictive path between digital social engagement, general smartphone use, and physical activity - selectively under lockdown conditions. Further, we observed a positive relationship between social media use and total daily steps across individuals during (but not prior to) lockdown. We interpret these findings in terms of individuals using these digital tools to harness online social support structures, which may help guard against negative effects of in-person social deprivation and other pandemic-related stress. Monitoring of these measures is low burden and unintrusive and therefore, given appropriate consent, could potentially help identify individuals who are failing to engage this mechanism, providing a route to early intervention in this and other vulnerable populations.\"\n",

Indeed, clinical trials have already been undertaken with promising results. Here we review the current state of the RNAi field for the treatment of viral infections such as HIV, human papillomavirus and HCV. We also review novel strategies including the concept of targeting self-genes to limit viral infection and activating the immune system for improved outcomes.

      "\"The social psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical staff in China: A cross-sectional studyBACKGROUND. The COVID-19 outbreak required the significantly increased working time and intensity for health professionals in China, which may cause stress signs. METHODS. From March 2–13 of 2020, 4,618 health professionals in China were included in an anonymous, self-rated online survey regarding their concerns on exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaires consisted of five parts: basic demographic information and epidemiological exposure; occupational and psychological impact; concerns during the episode; coping strategies; and the Huaxi Emotional-Distress Index (HEI). RESULTS. About 24.2% of respondents experienced high levels of anxiety or/and depressive symptoms since the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents who worried about their physical health and those who had COVID-19 infected friends or close relatives were more likely to have high HEI levels, than those without these characteristics. Further, family relationship was found to have an independent protective effect against high HEI levels. Their main concerns were that their families would not be cared for and that they would not be able to work properly. Compared to respondents with clear emotional problems, those with somewhat hidden emotional issues adopted more positive coping measures. CONCLUSIONS. About a quarter of medical staff experienced psychological problems during the pandemic of COVID-19. The psychological impact of stressful events was related to worrying about their physical health, having close COVID-19 infected acquaintances and family relationship issues. Therefore, the psychological supprot for medical staff fighting in the COVID-19 pandemic may be needed.\"\n",

      "\"Outcomes of Laparoscopic Hiatal Hernia Repair in Nine Bariatric Patients with Prior Sleeve Gastrectomy.BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) may exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients with a hiatal hernia (HH). Surgical repair may be needed, however prior LSG precludes standard HH repair with fundoplication. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our experience with bariatric patients with prior LSG undergoing laparoscopic HH repair from August 2010 to July 2016. Patient demographics and outcomes including mortality, length of stay (LOS), readmission rates, reoperation, and complications were described. A validated 13-point questionnaire was used to determine symptomatic relief, weight loss, and overall satisfaction. RESULTS A total of nine consecutive patients with prior LSG underwent HH repair and were included in the analysis. Repair was performed using Bio-A Gore® mesh (W.L Gore Inc., Newark, DE) in six (66.7%) cases and posterior cruroplasty in three (33.3%) patients. Heartburn was significantly decreased at 1 year (1.4 ± 0.9 vs. 2.6 ± 0.9, p = 0.031), and 78% of patients reported some degree of symptomatic relief after HH repair. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic HH repair offers a safe and feasible approach in the management of persistent GERD after LSG in well-selected bariatric patients. Larger prospective studies are warranted to investigate the effectiveness of HH repair in this population as 22% of our patients did not demonstrate postoperative symptomatic improvement.\"\n",

      "\"Comparison of the Laboratory Data Between Kawasaki Disease and Enterovirus After Intravenous Immunoglobulin TreatmentKawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. The laboratory findings before and after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in KD have been discussed, but the characteristics of IVIG therapy still are unclear. This study aimed to compare laboratory data from patients with KD and enterovirus (EV) infection to evaluate the differences after IVIG therapy. The study enrolled 171 KD patients and 38 EV patients treated with a single dose of IVIG from 2003 to 2010. Laboratory data including total white blood cell counts (WBC) and hemoglobin (Hb), platelet, segment, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and monocyte levels were analyzed. Compared with the KD patients, the EV patients had higher Hb, lymphocyte, and monocyte levels and lower eosinophil levels before IVIG treatment (p < 0.05). After IVIG treatment, the KD patients had lower Hb and segment levels but higher platelet, lymphocyte, and eosinophil levels than the EV patients (p < 0.05). In the KD patients, the platelet, eosinophil, and monocyte levels increased after IVIG treatment, whereas Hb, WBC, and segment levels decreased significantly (p < 0.001). In the EV patients, eosinophil levels increased after IVIG treatment, whereas WBC and Hb levels decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The study results provide evidence that eosinophilia may be related to IVIG therapy in KD and EV patients. The KD patients had higher eosinophil levels both before and after IVIG therapy than the EV patients, which may have been due to the inflammatory mechanism of KD. The KD patients had higher platelet levels than the EV patients, suggesting that platelets are involved in the inflammatory response to KD.\"\n",

STUDY DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Four geographically dispersed tertiary sleep disorder referral centers. METHODS Subjects with mild to moderate sleep apnea dissatisfied with CPAP because of pressure-related complaints were randomized to receive Pillar implants or a sham procedure performed in double-blind fashion. Active and sham groups were compared for changes in therapeutic CPAP pressures (primary outcome) with a 90-day follow-up sleep study and CPAP compliance (secondary outcome) with a 90-day smart card report. RESULTS Twenty-six subjects were randomized to Pillar implants and 25 to a sham implant procedure. There were no differences between groups with regard to demographics and baseline parameters. Both sham and active groups had reduced mean CPAP pressure (-1.1 vs -0.5 cm H(2)O) with no difference between groups (P = .32) at 90-day follow-up. In addition, there was no difference in average daily CPAP use between groups (P = .80). Both groups experienced improvements in Epworth sleepiness scores and Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire scores at 90 days with no differences between groups. The active group reported significantly higher CPAP satisfaction scores than the sham group (P = .04). CONCLUSION Pillar implants do not significantly reduce CPAP pressure or increase CPAP compliance compared to sham controls but may subjectively improve CPAP satisfaction. These findings do not presently support the use of Pillar implants as an adjunctive treatment to improve CPAP compliance.\"\n",

It briefly mentions clinical diseases and syndromes such as influenza, respiratory tract infections, hepatitis, and arbovirus infections resulting from virus infections. Viruses causing respiratory diseases, as well as many other diseases in humans are also discussed in the chapter. It describes the vaccines that are used to check the attack of different viruses as well as their cost-effectiveness. There is a list of some viruses that have been ranked according to different variables in an attempt to select a good candidate for an antiviral drug. The incidence of the viral disease is naturally an important factor, as is the severity of the disease. The incidence can be obtained for diseases being reported in accordance with local regulations, but in many cases viral diseases are not reported and the incidence has to be calculated from different surveys. Also, a grading of the severity is not easy and an example is when herpesvirus infections are handled as a group, which includes both herpes encephalitis and cold sores. The greatest challenges and probably the most difficult and medically important areas for prophylaxis and therapy of viral diseases are the viruses that are rapidly changing in antigenic composition and/or viruses with animal reservoirs (influenza and arboviruses) and those forming latent infections (herpesviruses).\"\n",

      "\"Comparing Rapid Scoring Systems in Mortality Prediction of Critically Ill Patients With Novel Coronavirus DiseaseOBJECTIVES: Rapid and early severity‐of‐illness assessment appears to be important for critically ill patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19). This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the rapid scoring system on admission of these patients. METHODS: A total of 138 medical records of critically ill patients with COVID‐19 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission used for calculating Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for analysis. All patients were divided into two age subgroups (<65 years and ≥65 years). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed for overall patients and both subgroups. RESULTS: The median [25th quartile, 75th quartile] of MEWS of survivors versus nonsurvivors were 1 [1, 2] and 2 [1, 3] and those of REMS were 5 [2, 6] and 7 [6, 10], respectively. In overall analysis, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.833 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.737 to 0.928), higher than that of MEWS (0.677, 95% CI = 0.541 to 0.813). An optimal cutoff of REMS (≥6) had a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 69.8%, a positive predictive value of 39.5%, and a negative predictive value of 96.8%. In the analysis of subgroup of patients aged <65 years, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.863 (95% CI = 0.743 to 0.941), higher than that of MEWS (0.603, 95% CI = 0.462 to 0.732). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study was the first exploration on rapid scoring systems for critically ill patients with COVID‐19. The REMS could provide emergency clinicians with an effective adjunct risk stratification tool for critically ill patients with COVID‐19, especially for the patients aged <65 years. The effectiveness of REMS for screening these patients is attributed to its high negative predictive value.\"\n",

      "\"Virion glycosylation governs integrity and infectivity of infectious pancreatic necrosis virusThe possible importance of the O‐linked glycosylation in virion stability and infectivity of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) was analysed. Enzymatic treatment with O‐glycosidase of radiolabelled virions under different ionic conditions, to allow for possible alternative exposure of glycosidic enzyme cleavage sites, did not alter the specific infectivity of virions re‐isolated after rate‐zonal centrifugation in glycerol gradients. As an alternative method to assess the significance of carbohydrates in IPNV integrity, periodate oxidation in the presence of an aldehyde quencher was chosen. Following re‐isolation of viruses, a 3–5 (10)log‐unit reduction in specific infectivity was revealed and, at higher concentrations, a total disruption or virion aggregation was observed. The loss of infectivity of intact virions was not because of a lack of attachment to cells. Additionally, re‐evaluation of reading values from UV‐spectra of purified IPNV yielded a specific infectivity of 3 × 10(11) TCID(50)‐units mg(−1) of protein and a ratio of 40 virions per TCID(50)‐unit in the CHSE‐214 cell system.\"\n",

      "\"Frequency and relevance of anterior cerebral artery embolism caused by mechanical thrombectomy of middle cerebral artery occlusion.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Spread of thrombus material in previously unaffected vessels is a potential hazard of mechanical thrombectomy, but it has not yet been investigated in detail, to our knowledge. Our purpose was to evaluate the frequency and relevance of these events in mTE of M1 occlusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated for isolated M1 occlusion between January 2008 and July 2012. Angiographic images were analyzed to assess emboli in anterior cerebral artery branches induced by mTE and associated devices. Recanalization attempts in the ACA were reported as well as technical success and adverse events of rescue therapies. ACA infarcts on follow-up imaging served as a surrogate for clinical relevance. ACA infarcts were quantified volumetrically and assessed visually for involvement of motor or supplementary motor areas. RESULTS New ACA emboli occurred in 12 of 105 (11.4%) M1 recanalization procedures and were caused by a stent-retriever in 11 intances. Attempts to recanalize the ACA were made in 6 patients and were deemed technically successful in 5 with no adverse events. We detected 6 (5.7%) new infarcts on follow-up imaging with an average volume of 26.9 cm(3). Involvement of motor or supplementary motor areas was seen in 4 (3.8%) cases. Three patients developed ACA infarcts despite successful endovascular ACA recanalization. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of ACA emboli in mTE of M1 occlusions is relevant, causing ACA infarcts in 5.7% of patients; 3.8% of emboli were likely to hamper motor-function recovery. Endovascular recanalization of major ACA branches reduced the incidence of infarcts with no adverse events.\"\n",

      "\"Poliovirus Replication Requires the N-terminus but not the Catalytic Sec7 Domain of ArfGEF GBF1Viruses are intracellular parasites whose reproduction relies on factors provided by the host. The cellular protein GBF1 is critical for poliovirus replication. Here we show that the contribution of GBF1 to virus replication is different from its known activities in uninfected cells. Normally GBF1 activates the Arf GTPases necessary for formation of COPI transport vesicles. GBF1 function is modulated by p115 and Rab1b. However, in polio-infected cells, p115 is degraded and neither p115 nor Rab1b knock-down affects virus replication. Poliovirus infection is very sensitive to BFA, an inhibitor of Arf activation by GBF1. BFA targets the catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1. Nevertheless the BFA block of polio replication is rescued by expression of only the N-terminal region of GBF1 lacking the Sec7 domain. Replication of BFA-resistant poliovirus in the presence of BFA is uncoupled from Arf activation but is dependent on GBF1. Thus the function(s) of this protein essential for viral replication can be separated from those required for cellular metabolism.\"\n",
